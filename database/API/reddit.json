Also I updated it to 32 GBs of RAM as 16 was way too small to do any amount of having multiple IDE windows open + running at least 1 VM.\n\nI don't need a lot of GPU grunt, I used to imagine I'd play games and do Machine Learning on my laptop but instead I've just got a powerful desktop, so I don't want an external GPU, and Intel iGPUs have always caused me nothing put pain, so I'm looking for an AMD APU set up.\n\nI probably don't need 64 GBs of RAM yet, but it seems these days most laptops don't offer the ability to upgrade.\n\nI don't have a hard limit on a budget, I'd prefer less than $2k, but if something fits my needs perfectly I'd spend more. Also I'd be willing to wait till the end of the year if something is expected to come out that would better fit my requirements.\n\nI've struggled finding something close to my requirements, it seems the laptop market has gone in a different direction than what I'm looking for.",

        "description": "If you use Pip to manage your Python environment, constraints files can be a powerful tool to manage dependencies and protect yourself from transitive dependency changes. I've never seen much written about them so here's a quick explanation and some examples:\n\n## What are Transitive Dependencies?\nA transitive dependency is a dependency of a dependency. Even if you pin all your direct dependencies in your requirements file, a transitive dependency like numpy might still update between installs, causing unexpected behavior.\n\n## What are Constraints Files?\nConstraints files let you specify version restrictions on packages. If you specify a constraint of `numpy==1.24.2`, numpy won't be installed unless it's a direct requirement or dependency. If numpy is a requirement or dependency, the constraint only accepts `numpy==1.24.2`. No other version of numpy can be installed, and any requirements or dependencies must be compatible with this constraint.\n\n## When Would You Use This?\nConstraints files solve a few problems for me:\n\n### Keeping different environments in sync\nUse constraints files to ensure development, testing, and production environments are not using conflicting transitive dependencies. To do this:\n\n- Create and activate a virtual environment\n- Install **all** of your requirements, e.g. `pip install my_package -r requirements-dev.txt`\n- Create a constraints file by freezing the environment, `pip freeze &gt; constraints.txt`\n\nNow you can install your package and guarantee the environment is in sync with your dev environment, e.g. `pip install my_package -c constraints.txt`\n\n### Installing into an existing environment without affecting existing packages\nUse constraints files to install a new package without changing any of the existing packages in your environment. To do this:\n\n- Freeze your current environment with `pip freeze &gt; constraints.txt`\n- Install a new package with `pip install &lt;new package&gt; -c constraints.txt`\n\nYou can also replace all the \"==\" in the constraints.txt with \"&gt;=\" to make sure nothing gets downgraded, or \"&lt;=\" to make sure nothing gets upgraded.\n\n### Providing your library as an application\nIf you provide a python library as an application, use constraints to say \"this is the exact set of dependencies and transitive dependencies I used to test the application against\". This saves users a lot of pain if new releases of transitive dependencies break your application.\n\n## Why Not Pin All Your Dependencies and Transitive Dependencies in Your Requirements?\nPinning all your dependencies and transitive dependencies in your requirements can make them more complex and difficult to manage. Instead, separating out the difference between \"packages I use directly to get my thing working\" and \"this is the universe of things in my environment\" can make your requirements more minimal and flexible, which tends to make them easier to manage.",

Expect to wait at least 10 to 15 minutes per 15 people in front of you, bear in mind once you get inside you'll have to go through a security scan and wait another 10 minutes.\n\nI really enjoyed it, it was a fun immersive experience. And I really hope more companies do off-site at NYCC like this.\n\nSpoilers explanation of what happens: You are taken into a small room that starts to fill with smoke, Neil Gaiman's recorded voice gives you an introduction. Then you are shuttled through a series of small rooms where you hear excerpts of The Sandman, each room has lots of clever visuals and audio to immerse you into the weird vibe. The whole thing took between 10 and 15 minutes.",

The trick was to set the search parameters to say only look to book Thursday night or Sunday night and see what hotels became available.\n\nAfter doing this for a few days I was able to book the Hilton Gaslamp for Thursday night and Friday night. Then over the next few days of going in and refreshing I was able to change my reservation to include Saturday night, and then Sunday night.\n\n**tl;dr** Your best chance still remains with the lottery, but people can and do get hotels booking on the onPeak website in the few weeks before the convention (though obviously don't count on it).",
