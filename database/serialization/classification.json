The enigmatic allure of black attire witnessed on the runway encapsulates a dynamic spectrum of hues, ranging from profound charcoal blacks to inky, deep shades, often sprinkled with subtle, faded variations. 1. Accents of Aesthetic Colours: The color palette for the black outfits ranged from deep charcoal black to rich and intense deep black shades. However, to enhance the impact of black, designers strategically introduced accents of color.  Aesthetic hues, including red, green, blue, and off-white, offered a captivating contrast to the dominant black tones.  This interplay of colors created visually striking ensembles that spoke to the intersection of tradition and contemporary fashion and showcased the versatility of black in fashion. 2. Design Details: Designers explored a diverse range of textiles and fabric manipulation techniques. Notable trends included fully laced fabrics and the incorporation of delicate lace elements. Transparent fabrics made a captivating appearance, emphasizing the importance of texture in fashion.  Hand-embroidered details adorned several looks, featuring intricate patterns such as zigzags, leaves, and floral motifs.  The infusion of fringe added movement and flair to the outfits. Fabric manipulation techniques, including ruching, gathers, cascades, 3D petals, and beadwork, demonstrated creativity and craftsmanship. 3. Neckline and Sleeve Diversity: The neckline and sleeve designs exhibited remarkable diversity, spanning from sleeveless creations that exude minimalist elegance to strikingly exaggerated sleeves that demand attention.  Alongside these extremes, we observed the timeless appeal of classic shirt sleeves. Complementing this spectrum, necklines ranged from elegant high necklines to alluring plunging variations and sleek V-neck designs, each contributing to the distinct personality of the ensembles.

                    "description": "I’ve gone through and reviewed the filings of a few of the SPACs that have completed their mergers over the last 6 months or so; GMHI, NPA, and IPOE. Hopefully this provides a little guidance on what to expect in the next week or so with the release of the 10Q. Apologize in advance as this is on mobile. \n\nGMHI: Announced merger with Luminar 08/24/2020; the original S-1 was filed on 12/10/2018. About a 20 month period. \nFinal 10Q prior to announcement: Filed on 08/06/2020. Reading through the MDA, there is NO relevant information regarding a potential merger and, in fact, explicitly states that no substantive discussions had been made as of 06/30/2020 (filing period). \n\nNPA: announced merger with AST on 03/31/2021; original S-1 filed 08/23/2019 (17months). \nFinal 10K prior to announcement filed 02/26/21. Reading MDA under Current Events subheading: “as of December 15, 2020 we have entered into an equity purchase agreement with AST” Note, this is an event that was contained within the reporting period\n\nIPOE: announced merger with SoFi on 04/09/21; original S-1 filed 10/06/2020 (6months).\nFinal 10K prior to merger filed 03/17/2021. Reading MDA under Current Events subheading “an agreement and plan of merger has occurred as of January 7, 2021 with SoFi...(some details about PIPE as well)”. Note, this is AFTER the reporting period has closed. \n\nI’ll let this be up to the individual’s interpretation, but a couple of interesting things 1) for GMHI, there was an omission of any “material or substantial” negotiations despite announcement happening just 14 days subsequent to the 10Q being filed. 2) IPOE disclosed their agreement even though it was a subsequent event to the reporting period. This is fairly interesting to me and makes me curious about how Bill would end up playing this if he does in fact have a target. Does he go the GMHI route and omit disclosure by waiting as long as possible to sign or does he follow IPOE and sign &amp; disclose an agreement shortly after the period end date (03/30/21)?",

The Black Metal Terrorist.\n\nA man of many names and talents, Denzel Curry is a rapper from Carol City, Florida who has been making some of the most head-banging yet simultaneously nuanced hip-hop out there for a better part of the last decade.\n\nThough most people know him as the guy who rapped fast to kids flipping water bottles, Curry’s albums present an artist with much more musical depth and variation than the memes tied to him would suggest. To bring to light how complete an artist Curry is, we wanted to examine his lyrics with text mining methods to uncover specific lyrical insights.\n\n**Methodology**\n\nThe data for this project was taken from genius.com. To scrape the lyrics, we used the “genius” package in R, which allows one to get all the lyrics of any song or album for any artist. For this portion of our project, we used the lyrics from *TA13OO*.\n\nWhen humans read text, we often try to think of its emotional intent, allowing us to classify the general mood and tone of the writing. Sentiment analysis has the same objective, as it attempts to find the underlying sentiments of a certain chunk of text.\n\nOften, sentiment analysis marks text by using dictionaries. Dictionaries such as *AFINN*, *bing* and *nrc* give either sentiment scores for certain words or categorize words into different sentiments. Using these, we often assign scores or sentiments to each word in a body of text and either take the sum of our sentiments or calculate scores to develop quantitative measures of sentiments. For our project, we used the *nrc* lexical from the “tidytext” package in R, which is a 2-column dataframe of 6468 unique words and the sentiments that they convey: positive, negative, anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, and trust.\n\nTo prepare our data for analysis, we implemented a natural language processing concept known as lemmatizing. Lemmatizing involves converting a word to its root word, or ‘lemma’; for example, words such as “playing” and “played” simply become “play”. This makes it easy for our NLP dictionary to limit our analysis to one variation of a given word, since different forms of a word generally carry the same sentiment.\n\nIn order to ready our scraped lyrics for sentiment analysis, we parsed the line-by-line lyrics into separate words on each row. Then, we inner-joined our dataframe of lyrics with the *nrc* lexical. The output was a data frame with each word in the lyrics and its associated sentiment. We condensed the data and added up the counts for sentiments by song, thus giving us sentiment counts for each of the ten sentiments for all songs.\n\n**Welcome to the Darker Side of Taboo**\n\nLast year, Curry released a riveting 13-track personal odyssey in *TA13OO*. One of the best hip-hop albums of the decade thus far, *TA13OO* boasts an incredibly wide range of hip-hop sensibilities; from braggadocious, trunk-knocking trap bangers to relatable, introspective ballads, the album features a trove of material that almost any music fan could find enjoyment in.\n\nOne interesting aspect that accentuates the variety of material on the album is the concept that Curry focused the album around. He parsed and released the album in three acts: Light, Gray and Dark. The music starts out relatively upbeat and vibrant in the leading Light act. As we progress through the album, the music and lyrics both get increasingly dark and despondent, culminating in a furious storm of an ending. While the album as a whole has a predominantly melancholic tone, it evolves musically and lyrically through the acts to develop its concept.\n\nWe thought it would be particularly interesting to analyze this album through the lens of sentiment analysis, since the album is largely centered on a variety of emotions. We wanted to know if analytical methods of text analysis could give us an interesting point of view on the music at hand. Thus, we grouped the songs in *TA13OO* by act and examined sentiment distributions through the album.\n\n**Light Act**\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/RqVJKws\n\nAs evidenced by the plot, the Light act has a fairly even spread of emotions throughout. One might be surprised to observe that seemingly negative emotions such as negativity itself, anger and fear match and even outrank seemingly positive emotions such as positivity itself, joy and trust. However, as previously mentioned, the album has undercurrents of gloom throughout. Take the opening track, “Taboo”, for example; though this song opens the Light act, the subject matter is intensely sorrowful, as he calmly sings to a victim of molestation, perhaps in an attempt to cope with some personal demons. Some tracks, such as “Black Balloons”, exemplify the balanced nature of this act of the album. On this song, Curry and GoldLink mull over the depressive thoughts that hang over their heads in the form of black balloons. Though the song deals with many sinister emotions, the ultimate message of the song is one of perseverance:\n\n&gt; Soon, black balloons pop / Let it be the day the pain stops.\n\nFollowing these songs, the Light act features the most bright material on the album. Specifically, the song “Cash Maniac” has the highest sentiment counts on the entire album for anticipation, joy, positivity and trust, which makes sense as this song features Curry frivolously celebrating all of the money he has earned thus far. This continues onto the next track “Sumo”, where Curry transitions to brashly bragging about his wealth while still keeping the mood upbeat on this aggressive hit of a song.\n\n**Gray Act**\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/Gu1YSIg\n\nMoving into the Gray side, there is a distinct spike in many negative sentiments. Sentiment counts for disgust, fear and negativity n2024-03-18T10:19:34.289721944Z early double relative to those in the Light act. In terms of negativity, three of the five most negative songs by count of negative words fall in this act of the album. At the start of the Gray act, we get “Super Saiyan Superman” a distinctively ethereal yet similarly boastful banger to the previous “Sumo”. Then, Curry brings “Switch It Up” and “Mad I Got It”, which both touch on a looming sense of paranoia that pervades through Curry’s entire discography. He fears people whom he perceives as his real friends turning on him on “Switch It Up”, and goes so far as to tell a story of a former friend holding him at gunpoint due to jealousy of his success and riches on “Mad I Got It”. The next two songs paint different shades of hopelessness in the album in the form of social commentary. “Sirens” bluntly addresses the political climate of the country with respect to issues such as police brutality and Donald Trump, while “Clout Cobain” sharply addresses the destructive nature of the clout-chasing circus that many young rappers in the music industry unfortunately find themselves embroiled in. According to sentiment counts, “Sirens” ranks in the top three songs in anger and fear among the whole album, and “Clout Cobain” ranks in the top four songs in negativity.\n\n**Dark Act**\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/GLtRhfe\n\nFinally, we reach the Dark act, which is by far the most vitriolic of the album. Thus far, the album has steadily mounted in dark emotions, which results in the explosion of rage that is this act of the album. Relative to the previous acts, sentiments such as anticipation, joy, positivity and trust are far lower than anger, disgust, fear, negativity, and sadness. The opener to the Dark act “The Blackest Balloon” continues some of the themes of the previous songs with a significantly sharper edge, containing material on Curry’s late brother haunting him and the untimely death of Lil Peep. “Percs” builds on these previous tracks from a unique angle, as Curry furiously differentiates himself from his peers, specifically in his opposition to recreational use of pills such as percocets and to unintelligible, mumbled flows. After these tracks, we reach the nastiest song on the whole album: “Vengeance”. By sentiment counts, this song leads the album in anger, disgust, fear, negativity and sadness; quite the violent song, as the title suggests. This song definitely fits the bill that our sentiment analysis tags it with, as Curry, JPEGMAFIA and ZillaKami all deliver murderous verses with junkyard flows that culminate into a beautifully vicious package, matched with an equally enjoyably reprehensible video. Finally, the album ends on “Black Metal Terrorist”, an absolute barrage of aggressive rhymes revolving around Curry trailblazing his path of greatness through other rappers.\n\n**Conclusions**\n\n[Here are all sentiment counts per act of the album.] (https://gist.github.com/nikhil348/b70160f08cae0f03f6f7cf62af61646d#file-summary_sentiments-csv)\n\nOverall, we feel that our sentiment analysis confirmed and enhanced our understanding of the concept of Curry’s album. As the acts of the albums got darker, so did the tone of the music, as we can confirm both by listening closely and our sentiment analysis. Unfortunately, there were some difficulties that we did our best to mitigate but were still prevalent. Unigram analysis often does not account for the context of a single word within the frame of a sentence. In the *nrc* lexical, the word “cash” is tagged as anger, anticipation, fear, joy, positivity and trust. The problem here, in the framework of our project, was that it initially classified “Cash Maniac”, unequivocally the most jubilant song on the album, as an angry and fearful one because of the sheer number of times the word “cash” is used in the song. Though we were able to spot this and alter the sentiment counts for that specific song, similar issues might have occurred in our analysis without our knowledge.\n\nThus, a next step might be to consider analyzing the lyrics using n-grams to gauge our sentiments more accurately. Still, we have something quite fascinating here, as even a relatively rudimentary analysis of the data fully supports our ear-test as music fans, showing us the power of sentiment analysis.\n\nOne of the punchier lines on *TA1300* comes from “Switch It Up”, where Curry says:\n\n&gt; They only know Denzel Curry / But they really don’t know Denzel!\n\nHopefully, we now have a better understanding of who he is, and how he works with and incorporates certain emotions in his music.\n\n\nIf you would like to read our full article, including more analysis on Curry's discography as a whole, you can check it out [here.] (https://medium.com/@ucladatares/analyzing-denzel-currys-lyrics-through-text-mining-methods-63608318d2)\n\nIf you would like to see our code, you can check it out [here.] (https://github.com/nikhil348/Denzel-Curry-Sentiment-Analysis).\n\nWe would like to acknowledge two sources which helped us immensely:\n\n* [Using Data to Find the Angriest Death Grips Song: A Code Through] (https://towardsdatascience.com/angriest-death-grips-data-song-anger-code-through-r-ded3aa2fe844) by Evan Oppenheimer\n* [Sentiment analysis with tidy data] (https://www.tidytextmining.com/sentiment.html)",

Once the model has been trained and checked, it's put into a real setting. This might be in a company's system, a mobile app, or an online site. Deploying the model means people can now use it and benefit from it. It helps businesses offer helpful services to users. Different methods exist to launch an AI model. The right method depends on the company's requirements. #tech #futuretech #techtok #ai #artificialintelligence ",

I’ve gotten my eliminations:deaths up to about 3.85 for the season, but I’m still below 50% winrate.\n\nJust some history: I switched from console to pc about 4 months ago, and had a lot of trouble with the switch to mouse and keyboard. About three weeks ago, something clicked, and I went on a tear. I’ve gained about 500 SR in the last two weeks, but I find myself fairly regularly having games like this: [Hanamura vod](Https://YouTu.be/M0H1xWjqd2M#t=46m30s).  Hanamura game starts at 46:30.\n\nIn this game, I felt like I did well, statistically, but not well enough to win. I know I should have ulted on point 1 defense. I kept waiting for the “right” opportunity, but I should have thrown it before I got hooked. Would’ve bought at least another 15 seconds for the team to get there and might have gotten a pick or two. It may have saved the point.\n\nThis is a particularly egregious example of feeling like I had great individual play but not being able to get it done, but this type of game happens to me fairly regularly. I feel like there must be something systematically wrong with what I’m doing, or a mistake that I’m making regularly.\n\nI’ve been lurking for a while, but this is my first post. I want to get better at this game, individually and as a teammate. I’m clearly doing things incorrectly, otherwise I wouldn’t be stuck in silver. I’m just missing what it is.\n\nAny help would be much appreciated, thanks in advance.",

I saw others zoom ahead, and I didn’t want to fall behind!😪 I kept seeing girls in their twenties, at least 10 years younger than me, who built multi-million dollar businesses in just months. Now they were selling courses on how to do it too, so I bought in... ❌ But here’s the truth: 🤔 Building a successful brand and business on social media is more than just posting and waiting for sales... 🙅🏽\u200d♂️ It’s also not about following a social media guru’s course that promises you’ll make a 7-figure business in one year... 💁🏽\u200d♂️ Or lounging with your favorite drink in the Caribbean, working two hours a day on your laptop, and earning money in your sleep. Sure, it’s possible. And maybe those who tell you this have done it. But they’re not sharing the years of hard work, failed attempts, self-doubt, and the truth: it’s not that simple. Your first years as an entrepreneur will be tough. You need to be ready to WORK HARD... But even more important, you should focus on improving yourself. Becoming more self-aware can hugely impact your business success. So, are you working on your business only or on yourself too? PPS.

                        "To all solo-architects and anyone looking to set-up their own studio, these 3 books provide enormous value and alternative perspectives on traditional practice models. You may have seen the terrible (and outright sad) statistics released by the RIBA benchmarking survey, confirming the average revenue for a solo-architect studio at £52k.  The reality is at least 30% (probably conservative) of that is overheads - increasingly costly PI insurance, professional memberships, equipment, software etc- leaving a salary that’s barely liveable and absolutely not reflective of the architect’s value/education. You may think that your own studio removes the cap on your earning potential - which it does - but running a solo-practice that entirely relies on architectural services is very challenging.  The challenge is not only the winning of work. It’s the agreement of a fee that is an appropriate value exchange. It’s avoiding working unhealthy hours on multiple smaller projects to stay afloat. It’s the ability to both deliver and get paid on time when many factors are outside of your control (delayed planning decisions, paused work stages) etc. Of course there are systems and approaches that can significantly improve profitability on services - the Business of Architecture UK have lots of success stories - but I’m also interested in ways we can be creative to diversify revenue streams and ease the constant pressure of time spent = money earned. Eric Reinholdt paved the way for considering digital products we can share with others for a fee. If you aren’t aware of @30X40 Design Workshop you need to check out Eric’s work. The decision to explore this with Initiate has totally changed what I thought was possible and, quite unbelievably, digital product revenue is currently exceeding what i bill for services (thanks so much everyone 🙏🏻).  Supporting our core services with other streams can earn revenue irrespective of whether I’m at my laptop, at home ill, or picking my daughter up at nursery. I’d love to talk about these ideas with other architects, please do DM if you want to chat more 🤜🏼🤛🏼",
                        "When starting your own studio you’ll often hear, ‘it must be great to have control of your own time and do what you want?’ Yes, this is great but i’ve also found it one of the biggest challenges of solo-business. When you’re the only person to produce the work, manage projects, market the practice etc, it’s so easy to become chaotic.  Some days you might start sketching out ideas for a new project only to be distracted by a phone call from a contractor or an email from a client, work that’s absolutely necessary but disrupts the creative focus and flow you need as a designer. The only successful strategy I’ve found to control this is to implement Paul Graham’s Maker’s vs Manager’s Schedule which I first heard about from Eric Reinholdt of 30X40. I now plan my days as best I can around a schedule of AM making and PM managing, pushing all meetings, email responses and phone calls to the afternoon which frees up the mornings - when I feel most creative and inspired - for the work we all enjoy most. 2024 is the year i’m making every effort to protect my time and creative energy - I’m positive this will translate into better architecture for my clients. Let me know any tips that work for you. I’ll keep you updated with how I get on. #architecture #archipreneur #solopractice #soloarchitect #designstudio #architecturestudio #creativestudio",
                        "Iteration 1️⃣2️⃣3️⃣ No good architect produces one design idea and ends there.  Good design requires iteration, where we test ideas, sketch and sketch again. Every sketch either unlocking a new trail of thought or eliminating ideas that aren’t working out.  I’ve been looking at elevations for this historic barn conversion over the past few days, exploring ways of introducing natural light and passive ventilation with minimal demolition. In the timely LinkedIn words of Steven Biersteker, ‘if you dont test multiple ideas you will end up with a bad one’.

                        "Producing fee proposals and talking about money can be one of the most daunting and isolating aspects of running a solo-design business (especially as we designers aren’t always comfortable with talking money). This was certainly the case for me. However, if you’re leaving corporate practice to run your own studio, it’s critical you know your ‘Breakeven Rate’ to ensure your fees are sustainable and resilient. Here’s how I do it, and whilst issuing proposals and negotiating fees still brings me some baked-in apprehension, knowing my baseline brings me huge confidence. TIP 1: at the start it’s difficult to predict how many hours it will take you to complete your service. This is natural as your developing your own processes, but try to record the time spent and refine your offer over as you develop. TIP 2: start with super-lean overheads that will reduce your Breakeven Rate and allow you to be as profitable and flexible as possible. There’s no rush, and you can expand once you’ve found your feet. #architecture #archipreneur #architecturestudio #creativestudio #designer #designbusiness #startup #SmallBusiness #feeproposal ",
                        "My Client Onboarding Process 🤝🏼 1️⃣ Enquiry Email / Call Initial enquiries typically come via phone calls but also email or social media messages. This is our first point of contact where we discuss the broad details of your project together. 2️⃣ Assess Suitability Not every enquiry an architect will receive is a good fit for their skill set, experience and practice ethos, so we must assess whether we should take it on and can allocate it the resources it requires.  Sometimes projects are too large or too small / in a sector we do not have experience in / do not fit with our design ethos / are too far too travel / the timeline is too tight, etc.  If a project is a good fit, we move to the next stage. If it’s a not-so-good fit, we call to explain and are as helpful as possible by referring you to other suitable practices locally. 3️⃣ Consultation Call / Visit This is always a fun part of the process, where we meet each other (often on site), and discuss the high-level ideas, budget, timeline, fees and next steps for your project. This meeting is almost always filled with enthusiasm and excitement for what’s ahead. 4️⃣ Fee Proposal Following the consultation, we follow up with a detailed fee proposal for our services. We make sure to talk about our fees with you in the enquiry call and consultation meeting, so the proposal does not come as a surprise. 5️⃣ Contract + Pre-Commencement Fee Prior to starting work, we ensure an appointment contract and pre-commencement fee is agreed, setting us off on a correct, professional foundation. 6️⃣ Welcome Email + Client Portal Finally, to kick things off, we send a welcome email with a link to our Notion Client Portal, a platform where the key details of your project are stored and a space for ongoing collaboration together. 🔗 Client Portal available via link in bio Happy Friday everyone 🤜🏼🤛🏼 #architecture #onboarding #architecturestudio #designstudio #creativestudio #archipreneur #soloarchitect #clientportal #notion",

                        "As 2023 ends I’ve been reflecting on the progress of the studio and, as always, aim to make solo-practice as transparent as I can with you guys. 2023 has been an amazing year for Initiate. We’ve grown this account by +70k followers, made great connections and worked with wonderful clients. However, as some of you know, one of the greatest challenges as a sole-practitioner is resilience through time. This is especially the case in architecture, as we often rely solely on services which can be stop-start (often through no fault of our own - recession, clients pausing work, delayed planning approvals, etc). This unpredictability puts big pressure on cashflow. In response, 2023 has been a year of exploring resilience in my work by diversifying revenue streams. To share these, here are the five ways i’ve earned money this year and avoided sole-reliance on services (most money to least): 1️⃣ Architectural Services The majority of Initiate’s revenue comes from fees to design and deliver architectural projects. It’s been wonderful to work with a range of clients this year, including those in the private, public and third sectors. 2️⃣ Digital Products (I can’t believe I’m saying this..!) since launching digital products in July, the revenue has almost matched that of design fees. This is totally owed to the support of you guys, and I could not be more grateful. Digital products have become an invaluable supporting revenue stream and I’ve taken so much pleasure in seeing you use these. In 2024 I’ll be sharing more of the assets you guys have requested 🙏🏻 3️⃣ Consultancy to Others I’ve provided consultancy to my former practice/larger practices, specifically on the adaptive re-use of historic buildings. I charge an hourly rate for support with the design/delivery of projects. 4️⃣ Teaching at University I’ve taught design one-day-per-week at the WSA since 2021, which i value enormously. This is a consistent weekly income. 5️⃣ Affiliate Links I’ve been compiling a list of equipment/products I use in practice, providing affiliate links for those who are interested. The income is minimal but I enjoy sharing well crafted products and/or those that save me time.",

Family of four traveling to Phuket area in about two weeks, staying for two weeks. We\\'re contemplating canceling altogether, but are also trying to figure out what it would cost to get excellent insurance that would cover us in these unpredictable times.\n\nI think this situation might be complicated by the fact that we are US citizens living in South Korea, though we do have a US mailing address (but probably can\\'t say we \"reside\" in the US).\n\nHere\\'s what I\\'m looking for (I think):\n\n(1) Travel insurance that would help provide coverage for non-refundable costs. We have one expensive hotel room that is completely non-refundable already, one that is about to go non-refundable, and an AirBNB that will provide us 50% if we cancel by 12/15. After that, it\\'s 100% non-refundable. In total, it could be about $3000 US in non-refundable costs (if we have to cancel last minute or go into quarantine and not use these options). \n\n(2) Supplemental health insurance. We have private international health insurance, which states that it covers \"medically necessary\" COVID-related costs. Given what I\\'ve read here about asymptomatic cases and people who had to quarantine because they sat next to a positive person in transit, I realize that we probably need coverage even for treatment that is \\*not\\* deemed medically necessary. \n\nI\\'ve tried to use some of the travel insurance aggregators, but it says that no plans are available to cover me. Marriott links you to Allianz insurance, but it seems to be for US residents only. We do have an AMEX and reserved almost all of this through them, and it seems like people here have a positive opinion of their insurance.\n\nI haven\\'t lived in Korea very long, but can do more legwork here to figure out what insurance people typically buy here. But I thought someone on this forum might have some advice for a total newbie to this process.\n\nThanks for any help or suggestions you might have.

Cold water isn\\'t out of the question for something epic.  \n\nWhat water is great right now?  Catalina Islands?  ABC? Costa Rica?\n\nThe dates for the trip will be in October 17-20; traveling solo.  I live near Oakland, with access to OAK, SFO and San Jose airports.  \n\nI am open water diver cert, but reeeallly comfortable in the water so somewhat \"challenging\" dives are on the table.   My diving experience so far is lots and lots of NorCal free diving, lots of Hawaii, Tulum cenotes, and a few spots in the Caribbean when we went on a cruise 4 years ago.  \n\nBudget? ummmmm.....  middle of the road dive boat type experience is doable.",

The problem is that often times, people do not qualify as independent contractors per the IRS regulations. See below for more insight. \n\n********\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUFl...]\nguHRoo [https://www.guhroo.co/] \nLinkedin [https://www.linkedin.com/company/exec...] \nTwitter [https://twitter.com/ergpayroll]\n\n*******\n\nHiring someone as a Contractor a great opportunity to see if an Independent Contractor will fit in with the organization’s culture as well as whether the individual will be successful in the role for which he or she was contracted. Independent \n\nContractors who find success in their roles and fit in well with a company’s culture hold an advantage should they be hired to become regular employees of an organization as their learning curve is substantially shorter than that of an individual who is hired into the company from the outside. The Independent Contractor has already had an opportunity to become acquainted with the organization’s industry as well with the dynamic of its employees.\n \nAdditionally, opting to allow an Independent Contractor’s contract to expire if he or she is not a good fit for the organization is a simpler task than terminating a regular employee of the company. Some disadvantages, though, are that the employer has substantially less control over an Independent Contractor. \n\nIn addition, an Independent Contractor will not have the loyalty to the organization as would a regular employee. This can be problematic when employers need to strategize for succession planning and cross-training. With an Independent Contractor, employers do not have the same incentive to retain and train these workers as they would a regular employee of the organization. \n \nIf you are a business owner or contractor who provides services to other businesses, then you are generally considered self-employed.  If you are a business owner hiring or contracting with other individuals to provide services, you must determine whether the individuals providing services are employees or Independent Contractors and ensure that the workers are categorized in line with their status. \n \nIt is extremely important to note that the IRS does not allow all workers to be classified as Independent Contractors. The IRS has strict guidance regarding the classification of W-2 Employees verses 1099 Independent Contractors. The basic premise behind the determination is the amount of control that the company has over the worker and how the work is performed.  Another large contributing factor is how important to the work is to the company’s core business. \n \nThe IRS uses a 3-part test to determine whether an individual should be classified as an employee or contractor. This is certainly an area of the law where the IRS is increasing enforcement efforts.  Therefore, it is critically important to ensure that workers are not misclassified as 1099 Independent Contractors when they should be W-2 Employees. Misclassification could result in substantial back taxes, IRS penalties, liability for workplace injuries, retroactive benefits, attorney’s fees, and other monetary damages.\n\nThanks for watching!\n►WATCH NEXT\n✓ Top Mistakes Companies Are Making During COVID-19 - https://youtu.be/tCad_1Cy4IQ\n✓ How to create a marketing strategy + How to onboard remote employees | The Monday Marketing Meeting - https://youtu.be/9Evnj5TJYfo\n\n👉Enjoying the show?

Known as the gig economy, these workers perform tasks for customers that have been assigned to them through mobile apps. The gig workers, if labeled as independent contractors, are left without minimum wage, overtime, benefits, and other job protections that traditional employees receive. That's drawn the attention of some state governments that say gig workers are being misclassified as contractors to avoid costly benefits and payroll taxes. In this video featuring Bloomberg Law’s Erin Mulvaney, we explore why the companies and state governments are at odds over how to properly classify gig workers.

If someone wants to spend a ton of money on a venture with negative expected monetary value, why exactly are we stopping them? We don't do that in any other industry. To stick with the chess example, I am pretty sure a significant portion of the funding for US chess comes from one [really wealthy guy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_Sinquefield) who really likes chess. I don't think he is making money off it. But he is getting a lot of 'value' because he gets to see more of the thing he enjoys.\n\nThis is partly why determining what something is truly 'worth' is so incredibly difficult. It's not just anything that gives a net profit.\n\nLike no one thinks the Jimbo Fisher buyout is going to make those boosters money right? But there isn't a rule preventing that from happening. The boosters decided it was worth it to them to spend a truly horrific amount of money to make him not the coach of their favorite team.\n\nAnd if they decide that they want to spend a ton of money to make a random kid from Iowa their new backup center, okay. It's their money. They decided it's worth it to them so go for it.\n\n>Schools provide varsity sports as a service to enhance student life\n\nClub sports, sure. We are so unbelievably far from club sports.\n\nSchools sell the tv rights to media companies for billions of dollars. Multiple college coaches make more money than their equivalents in the professional league. Schools spend millions more building special facilities for athletes only, all to entice random high schoolers to come play football for them.\n\nThis is way more than a fun perk for students.\n\nBut at the end of the day, one of the best things about letting the free market decide how much these kids are truly worth is that if, as you say, they aren't actually worth much of anything, then nothing will really change. Eventually, the market would dry up, people will stop spending money to get kids to go to their schools, and you'd be left with a bunch of schools competing with basically club teams. If they are truly generating no value, neither monetarily nor whatever other kind of value getting rid of Jimbo is, then people won't spend that money.\n\nBut everything that CFB is and has been over the last few decades tells me that people absolutely will spend that money. And if they are willing, then that is the amount of value these kids are generating, that is the amount they are worth, and that is what they should be paid.",

NIL is the schools outsourcing paying their employees, and it's wild that they were able to do that. \n\nThis also leads to a ton of ridiculous scenarios where businesses have to get very creative with sponsorships to make sure the kid goes to the right school and they stop getting paid if they transfer out but they aren't allowed say anything explicit like that so it's just a weird series of clauses and loopholes meant to cover up the obvious reality.\n\nPlus boosters drive a lot of it and aren't (nominally) allowed to coordinate with the schools they are recruiting for so you get weird cases where boosters make promises to a kid the coach doesn't actually want and all the messiness that entails.\n\nThe schools are the ones the kids end up playing for, they are the ones who get most of the value either through happy boosters or cold hard cash from media companies, they should be the ones providing a majority of the payment. Even if the funding sources end up mostly the same where its a bunch of boosters donating to a specific athlete fund, that should be run by the school and independent of NIL. NIL shouldn't be pay to play. It should be for actual name, image, and likeness.",

A major non-SEC/B10 school offers their players more than 50% of revenue to remain competitive from a total earnings perspective.\n3. SEC/B10 unions start pushing for the same % split that the non-SEC/B10 team got, and the process continues until non-revenue sports are dead.\n\nThe power dynamic would also ensure that the players get 100% of what they asked for. Unless the networks or conferences would be willing to continue to pay TV revenue to schools whose athletes are striking (which I can't imagine they would be), a threat of a strike and losing 100% of revenue would leave administrators powerless to say no to any demand.\n\nSeems like we would just go straight from paying players nothing to blowing up the whole system while ignoring every potential middle ground option.",

                    "text": "I get that being an employee has quite a few benefits, but here me out. This is extremely bad. Maybe you like working for an employer. That's fine, but if you are a gig worker, being emoployee means all of the things that attracted you to being one will be gone overnight.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy main point is that as an employee, you are owned just like a slave. Yes, you are payed, so technically, it doesn't qualify as slavery, but courts have upheld firings over social networking posts which had nothing to do with work or the specific business in question. They have upheld firings of people for doing something outside of work and off of the employer's property. If your boss wants to fire you for being a scorpio, visiting a bar on the weekend, or making a political post about legalizing marijuana, there is no law, in most states, banning them from doing it.\r\n\r\nThey can promise you a forty hour workweek and suddenly require you to work sixty, threatening to fire you if you don't. Of course, not all employers do that, but they can. \r\n\r\nAs an independent contractor, you work for multiple bosses. One might be strict while others aren't so much. If you prefer to dress casually or not work weekends, the only thing that happens is that you lose a few of these bosses. You decide whether or not to follow certain rules to bring in more work. \r\n\r\n yes, your agent, someone like Uber or Lyft who provides you with work might have rules, so it can be similar, but currently, they are pretty hands off, and that's because of your classification as an independent contractor. It changes completely when you become an employee.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt won't be the same job but with a requirement that you get minimum wage and employee benefits like medical insurance. That would come at the price of being a gig worker. You would be a full time employee. You would work the hours your employer says to work. Yes, there are jobs where you do this anyway, but ride share drivers and delivery drivers currently enjoy flexibility which will disappear if they are classified as employees.\r\n\r\nEven our cab companies require that you work a shift. Yes, you lease the vehicle and operate basicly as your own boss, but the timing of the whole thing is up to the company who owns and maintains the vehicle. \r\n\r\nWhere I live, after traveling expenses, drivers are making $19 to $21 per hour on the top end. Yes, this is before taxes, but that means $13 to $15 after taxes, Fica, etc if you factor that in. If you are an employee, you get whatever the boss decides to give you regardless of how many passengers you pick up. In a slower market, this will be great for the few drivers on the road, because they will get payed way more for working less and get employee benefits, but if you carry a lot of passengers, there is no guarantee that you will be payed more for that. If there is a lot of competition for rides, that means there are too many drivers on the road, so Uber or Lyft won't hire as many or will lay people off. There might even be a required quota of fares you must carry to keep your job.  \r\n\r\nYou will also have to be hired as an employee. You won't be able to just download the app, fill out everything, photograph your license, plate, car, face, and insurance information, then wait for the back ground check, you'll have to apply, wait for an interview, then wait to be contacted. \r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, your pay will not be equal to your work. You might be payed based on an average of the amount of rides any particular driver sells in a given shift, but that's all you get no matter how many more than that average you pick up.If your boss decides to reward you, maybe you'll get a raise or bonus, just like if you kiss a lot of ass at Walmart or Amazon. In Evansville Indiana, you might be offered $13 an hour before taxes are taken out, and you'll take it or leave it. Delivery drivers get tipped, so you'll get less. You might get $7.25 and be told to be greatful, because tipped workers do not have to be given minimum wage, and your boss has been gracious enough to give that to you anyway.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course, I think a lot of you are counting on that $15 minimum wage to save you. I don't see that happening, but if it does, it won't save you. It'll just mean that you have to work for the largest companies around. Nothing smaller than a full sized conglomerate will survive without quickly rushing to mechanize everything and downsizing workers as well as outsourcing to countries with much lower minimum wages. Did you know, 9/11 has been outsourced in many places. You, for the time being, are transfered to an operator here in the United States before being connected back to your local emergency services, so the time you speak to a call center employee is short, and they do speak your language enough to understand you even if you are panicking, or maybe even injured yourself and seconds from death, but what if that changes? \r\n\r\nYou might have an emergency, dial 9/11, and hear a thickly accented voice say, \"Thank you for calling nine one one, how may I help you today,\" and you'll have to relay not only your address but the city, state, and the zipcode and possibly repeat it a few times. If you are on the side of the road somewhere, the operator will still need something to input in to the computer before they can transfer you to the right personel in your area, so you might just be screwed.\r\nCalifornia has given special treatment to Uber and Lyft, but will that spill over to the whole country if this is federalized? What about Grubhub, Doordash, Roadie, etc? There's no way of knowing what this administration will do, and many of you voted for Joe Biden, because at least he isn't Donald Trump. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't remember the bad ol orange man saying anything negative about the gig economy.",

                    "text": "“Employees’ lunches are their personal property and the company is not responsible for lost or stolen personal items.”Nobody likes a lunch thief, and I had one of the most aggressive at my office. \n\nThere were rumors for a few months leading up to the inciting incident of someone going around and taking peoples’ lunches. Just about every day someone different would complain that their lunch was missing. \n\nIt even happened to me once or twice, but I figured hey, it’s a big office, a few people are probably just careless and grab the wrong lunch and are too embarrassed to bring it back or someone else packs their lunch and they don’t know what’s in there so it’s not obvious they have the wrong one, or whatever. \n\nMost people just brought brown bags with their names on it anyways, or identical Rubbermaid Tupperware with a little piece of labeled tape on the side. It was easy enough to mix it up. \n\nI had accidentally grabbed a wrong lunch once or twice, but I’d noticed before I got it open. I thought I was just more careful, or even just not as busy, as some other people in the building. \n\nHowever, other people weren’t as forgiving, and a quorum made complaints to HR. They were blown off. Personally, at the time, I thought it was all much ado about nothing. \n\nBut then it began. My wife enrolled in a French cooking class online and just about every day I was bringing fancy gourmand leftovers in for lunch. You’d think I was picking up a to go bag from a Michelin starred bistro on the way in each morning, she really threw herself into the coursework.\n\nThere were no problems for about two weeks, maybe three, until one day my lunch went missing. Considering what delicacies I had to look forward to I was pretty miffed, but I did a once over around the break room and didn’t see anyone eating my lunch so figured someone grabbed my bag by accident earlier, saw how good things looked and—realizing it was their lucky day—didn’t bring it back to the fridge. \n\nI wrote the mysterious stranger off as an asshole but accepted the loss and looked forward to dinner that night instead. \n\nNext day I write my name on my lunch in extra bold lettering, jam the bag into the back of the fridge, and feel peace of mind. I get there come break time, nope, it’s gone. \n\nI was pretty upset, but I figured it was a stroke of bad luck, and left it at that. What else could I do?\n\nHowever, third day, out of an abundance of caution, I kept my lunch at my desk. A pain, because I had to eat it fairly early in the day to avoid spoilage, but at least I’d know where it was. \n\nI got up to take care of some business down the hall and when I came back… yep, my lunch was gone.\n\nUnfortunately that didn’t help me narrow it down much at all because my desk is centrally located so everyone’s constantly passing by. \n\nAt that point there was no possibility of the theft being arbitrary, so I approached HR and filed a complaint. Their response, practically verbatim, was, “Employees’ lunches are their personal property and the company is not responsible for lost or stolen personal items.”\n\nThe following day my wife packed a cream based soup that really had to be refrigerated. I was passing by the break room to check on my lunch practically every five minutes. Somehow it still managed to disappear. \n\nI was irate at this point and returned to HR and really blew my top. The best they could do was send a memo around about remembering to check the name on your lunch when you remove it from the fridge, but they made very clear that it was a routine memo and in no way related to my complaints, which were not their jurisdiction, so not an admission of responsibility, because my lunch was my own personal problem. \n\nThe only suitable alternative to packing a lunch available in the building are these wretched shrink wrapped ham and cheese sandwiches from a vending machine. \n\nThey’ve been marinating in the heat for God knows how long and the bread is as stale as cork board and the meat is rancid and there’s gluey mayo smushed into the center. It’s a relic of the old office tenants’ I’m pretty sure. \n\nI vented daily to my wife but her only idea was to start bringing a regular sandwich and apple again to dissuade the thief and get him to move on to other lunches. \n\nSo, determined prevent this low life scum from downgrading the quality of my lunch, I hatched an elaborate plan… Then the pandemic hit and I forgot all about this whole saga. \n\nI worked remotely for months and months. Then we returned, and after all that had happened globally, this was the last thing on my mind. \n\nBut I got to the break room the first day back, frustrated from having to wear a button up and tie after months of working in pajamas, sore from my desk chair, and exhausted from small talk, only to find… my lunch was gone. \n\nThis was a particularly sore point because my wife and I divorced between my last lunch and work and the present one. So I did not appreciate being reminded of any past threads involving her. \n\nI pretty much flew into a blind rage at that point. Especially seeing that stupid worthless memo about checking the lunch bag names posted in the break room, feeling so helpless and so hungry and so alone as it was me and my lunch against the world. \n\nI stormed out and was determined to return the next day with a plan. \n\nSo, I came in the following day… with an empty lunch bag. \n\nAnd I checked closely to be sure no one was watching and… I switched the contents of the HR person’s lunch bag into my bag. So now their lunch appeared to be my lunch. \n\nThey’d packed a regular brown bag, so I just discarded that, and I left, and I waited. I knew this was a pretty big gamble because it was contingent on the theory that the thief was avoiding me while having lunch, but not wary of anyone else. So would eat out in the open if there were no risk of bumping into me. \n\nSo I made a big show of going around the office announcing that I was headed out for a meeting and I wouldn’t be back until at least 3:00pm.\n\nI even went to the trouble of moving my car out of the lot to a space two streets over. Where I then sat in my car and worked remotely for several hours before sneaking\ninto the building up the back stairway.\n\nI then sat in the stairwell just outside the break room, where you can hear chatter can’t be seen, and after about 20-30 minutes of waiting, I heard it. \n\nThe sweetest sound I’ll ever hear in the office. \n\n(HR) “What the heck Kyle, that’s my lunch.” \n\n\n(Lunch thief!!) “Nah, it’s not your name on the bag.”\n\n(HR) Give me that! \n\n*I’m assuming grabs bag and sees my name.*\n\n(HR) Yah, let’s head to my office for a chat. \n\nThe HR rep later called me in as well and said they were “aware of my break room hijinks,” but it was obvious that the point still came across loud and clear. \n\nThey warned me that it was a violation of policy to move another employee’s lunch—it took every ounce of self control for me to keep from retorting “I thought our lunches were our personal property and the company was not responsible for them being lost or stolen?” \n\nThey informed me they’d located the thief and things would be handled accordingly. \n\nBut better than whatever write up they might be able to issue Kyle, his reveal as the lunch thief occurred in front of the whole break room. So word quickly spread as to who had been stealing everyone’s lunches earlier last year and he is now the office pariah. \n\nHe was in line for a promotion. The promotion is indefinitely off the table. \n\nAnd I also earned brownie points for exposing him, though more than I’m satisfied with are being attributed to HR. \n\nAt the end of the day though, I didn’t do this for this credit, or even the sweet sweet *sweet* revenge. I did it to get my lunches back.",

I left years ago, amicably after finding a new job. \n\nI saw this online from a store that is not the one I worked at and I gotta say, it’s fucking embarrassing. The context here, from what I gather, is that the employees are trying to unionize. \n\nManagement there is filled with pull-yourself-up-by-the-bootstraps type folks that think the admittedly good ESOP (that used to be way better) is worth living a life of poverty wages for. Winco gets a lot of good press for being an employee owned company but I don’t think that’s fair—it’s exactly as garbage as any retail experience and pays about as much. And I can’t even describe how shocked I was when I left and was treated like an adult for the first time in the workplace. \n\nWinCo hides behind its employee owned status, but make no mistake the employees have zero say in anything. There are committees that are constantly overruled by corporate whenever they try to advocate for themselves. And as you can see here, management isn’t above intimidation and bullying. \n\nGood luck to the folks still working there and I hope they find peace in the hell world we live in.",

Tell them! If Costco sees members turning to competitors they will act to keep your business.\n\nEDIT: I see a few comments about employees being rude, lying, and \"accidentally\" signing someone up for exec when they didn't want it.  I am not trying to make an excuse for this behavior. This shouldn't be happening.\n\nI just ask members to understand that when we ask you the same things every other week, it's not because we want to, we're told to.

                    "text": "I emailed a Valve employee about CS:GO (and got a response!)**Heres my initial email:**\n> Dear John McDonald,\n\n>I recently watched your talk at GDC 2018 about deep learning in CS:GO (which was great by the way) and I have a few questions of my own.\n\n>A recent update came out to CS:GO which changed a variable in the game files which broke nearly all aim and vision assistance cheats, which i'm sure you are aware of. **My question is: is it possible to change other variables during updates to repeat that effect?** Using this, or a similar, method would certainly deter cheaters and potentially work as an anti cheat. That said i'm not sure how that would effect server and client interaction, as there is probably a reason this hasn't been done already.\n\n>One of the questions at the conference talked about checking if a person really made the mouse movement and if they really are in total control of their player. **I was curious about, if using a learning program, you could track the speed of a players crosshair before taking a shot?** and using that, judge their accuracy and how straight of a line a player makes when flicking. Using a method like this could help detect aimbots because it is nearly impossible to make a completely straight line without external assistance, and doing that in milliseconds would be even harder. **If this is possible would it also be possible to use a modified version of it to detect wallhacks (seeing how close a players crosshair is to an enemy through a wall)?**\n\n>**Why is the report function unavailable in demos and watching live matches?** Being able to report players while having all the benefits of GOTV (xray and pov) would potentially increase the accuracy of player reports. Although I do see how it could be abused by cheaters using report bots. **Tied to this question, do reports through Steam do anything relevant to CS:GO?** (pressing report in a live game/ demo brings you to the players Steam profile.) \n\n>**What is your/Valve's opinion on partnering with 3rd party matchmaking services like FACEIT and ESEA?** Doing so could benefit both parties by having 128 tick matchmaking servers, as well as another anticheat, which could lead to older players who stopped playing because of those problems to come back, and new players coming to CS:GO because of those features.\n\n>**How much do you/the CS:GO dev team read feedback?** As replies from you guys in the subreddit are sparse.\n\n>All of my questions are in bold, the surrounding text is context and further explanation for the questions. Please pardon my bad explaining skills as well.\n\n>Your talk really inspired me to do more Overwatch cases and be overall a more active member of the community so thanks for that.\n\n>-MrLeJosh\n\n**His response:**\n>Changing variables is feasible, but it’s just a little treadmill. It breaks cheats for a small amount of time to work around but requires a fair amount of work on our side. That’s typically a bad tradeoff to make.\n\n>The learner we use tracks velocity of the view angles already—that’s one of the main things it is looking at. It’s not intuitively clear what a wall hack looks for.\n\n>I don’t have a well-formed opinion on third party matchmaking services. At first blush, it seems like they provide value to our mutual customers, which is great.\n\n>We read the feedback sent to the feedback alias, although there are times where the volume is too large for us to read every piece of mail sent.\n\n \n>Cheers,\n\n\n>McJohn\n\n(I shrunk down spaces between paragraphs so this post isn't *too* long)\n\nObviously John didn't answer all my questions fully, which I assume was due to Valve not wanting to release info on certain topics.\n\nI am sharing this in case anyone else had these questions, and to enlighten those who have been skeptical on Valves presence in CS:GO. (including me)\n\nIf you want to watch the GDC conference it is available [here](https://youtu.be/ObhK8lUfIlc)\n\nI asked John McDonald for permission to post this. (He said yes in case you weren't sure.)\n\n\nEDIT: I had a great time in this thread, I read nearly everyone's comments and replied to as many as I could. John even replied to a comment! I hope this thread helped out some people who were hazy/weary about the state of anticheat in CS:GO.",

Some of those homeless people died during the pandemic. The suspects include five Department of Homeless services workers, as well as employees of the NYPD, MTA, USPS and NYCHA. Prosecutors believe they are responsible for obtaining nearly $1.2 million in fraudulent benefits between April 2020 and October 2021. Officials say approximately 170 people had their identities stolen. It is alleged that the five DHS employees got shelter resident information from paper and digital files and shared them with the group. \"Stealing the identities of New Yorkers, many of them homeless, and defrauding a critical social safety program during one of the most challenging times in our city's history is downright shameful and we allege criminal,\" said District Attorney Alvin Bragg. Prosecutors say they were looking into a DHS employee who may have been manufacturing ghost guns when investigators discovered the other alleged fraud. All of the defendants pleaded not guilty on Thursday and the judge set bail for almost every suspect.#nyc #fraud #news ",
