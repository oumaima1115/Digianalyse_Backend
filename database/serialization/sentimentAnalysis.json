However, upon encountering robust psychological support at 0.6100, an influx of buyers has been observed. This surge in buying activity resulted in the formation of a higher high, providing confirmation for initiating long positions.

We are now seeing higher highs followed by higher lows being formed with strong bullish impulsive moves As we are coming off the back of a bullish impulse I am expected to see price retrace slightly to form a higher low.

Most of you will quit after a few months because you’re not making thousands or are driving a Lamborghini. Trading is a professional business and should be treated like one. With an industry with endless opportunities, did you really think it was going to be easy? This is my analysis on #EURUSD. We can see that price is beginning to form a rising wedge pattern towards a key area of resistance within the market around 1.1. A rising wedge tells us as traders that buying momentum is slowing down and sellers may be looking to take control of the market soon We have 3 possible entries for this trading scenario. The first one being our most risky entry at the top the rising wedge and rejection of the resistance. The second one being once confirmation of bearish market structure has taken place.

The structure is very fluent as it’s very clear as to who is in control of the market whether that being buyers or sellers This pair has a nice run to the downside forming lower lows and lower highs however now we can begin to see evidence of a market reversal.

However that doesn’t mean if we do see a larger pullback, we can’t capitalise on smaller moves on the lower timeframes Never marry a bias View the market from both a buyers and sellers perspective and then decide who has more confluences than the other at that given time For a sell position I will be looking for price to pullback and retest previous support as resistance. I will need to see a shift in momentum at this level to ensure it’s not a fakeout If it does end of being a fakeout I will look for buy positions as shown with a break and retest of the resistance as support Our services: ▪️Copy our trades for free ▪️Account management ▪️Funding challenges ▪️Courses ▪️Mentorship For more details on these services make sure you Send me a DM!

Remember this is just my analysis! This does not mean I have taken the trade of that my analysis is 100% going to be right. This is trading and we must remember that anything is possible and losses are a normal component of trading Starting on higher timeframes such as monthly and weekly we can see that the market is heavily downtrending. The most recent 2 monthly candles we can see that price has closed as a strong bearish engulfing candle. With the month coming to and end I am expecting a strong bearish close Dropping down the the lower timeframes such as 4hour and 1hour we start to get a feel for most recent price action and market structure. We can see that price has formed a head and shoulders pattern which is a bearish reversal pattern Want to know how I can help you? Send me a DM!

                        "Are you willing to flip the switch Price action today has played out beautifully on USDJPY and even for the last few weeks. Price opened this week with a huge gap to the downside which we understand as experienced traders, was most likely going to be filled Yesterday we executed sell positions into this gap and closed with discipline as we knew we was going against the higher timeframe trend. When going against the higher timeframe trend we are more inclined to trail stops aggressively or take profits sooner. Whereas if we are going with the higher timeframe trend, we will trail stops more loosely and target larger risk to reward ratios Looking at our specific buy position today we saw a nice inverse head and shoulders pattern with an entry on the right shoulder followed by a scale in position on the breakout of the corrective structure Note: we also took a few losses today which is completely normal in trading and should be accepted Want to know how I can help you this year?

                        "analysis on GBPJPY on the 5 minute timeframe Analysis of GBPJPY on the 5 minute timeframe reveals a notable prevalence of the Japanese Yen’s strength across the broader market, prompting a focused examination of GBJPY. Historically, a bullish market structure was observed, characterised by the formation of higher highs and higher lows. However, a recent surge in selling activity has manifested, instigating a robust bearish impulsive movement. The price has undergone correction, consistently retracing to the 78.6% Fibonacci level, thereby consistently breaching previous highs and triggering the liquidation of retail trader positions. This shift in market momentum provides a substantiated rationale for market entry. The proposed stop-loss strategy involves situating it above the previous support level, with a target set at the lower bound of 184.600. Anticipation of continued downward movement suggests additional opportunities for market entry in the future Want to know what services I provide?

                        "This is my analysis on USDCAD on the 1 hour timeframe The price consistently adheres to a bearish market structure, characterised by the formation of lower lows succeeded by lower highs, indicating a prevailing dominance of sellers in the market. The observed price movements exhibit bearish impulses followed by bullish corrections, manifesting in the breach of support levels subsequently repurposed as resistance. The recurrent pattern in price action suggests a systematic repetition, with the Fibonacci retracement serving as a valuable analytical tool. This tool is applied from the most recent swing high to swing low, leading me to anticipate a pullback to the 50% Fibonacci level Want to know what services I provide?

                        "EURUSD Analysis on the 30 minute timeframe Using the DXY as a confluence for this pair as I see a weak dollar overall sentiment Price has peviously beeen trading within bearish market structure forming lower lows followed by lower highs. However these bearish impulsive moves to the downside have been decreasing which is a sign of a falling wedge which is an early sign of a bullish reversal.  Using chart patterns we can see how price is forming an inverse head and shoulders pattern which is a bullish reversal pattern. I am looking for price to break structure with a higher high followed by a higher low for my entry as shown My stop loss will be below the most recent low point and i will be targeting the 1.0900 area Want to know what services I provide?

                        "EURCAD Analysis on the 1hour timeframe After breaking away from bullish market structure with a strong impulse move to the downside we are seeing price correct to the upside. This correction contains multiple retail traps which would have enticed traders to enter sell positions too early. What we have done is be patient and allow price to pullback further into our more probable areas of sensitivity.  The area i am looking for a rejection is at the 50% fibonacci retracement level which lines up with a key level within the market where price has been using it as a support and resistance in the market.  If we get the rejection at the 50% i will look to initiate a sell position with my stop loss above the 61.8% fib level and target the low point of around 1.45 psychological level. If we miss the move and price declines before this point i will look to enter the market on a structure shift on the lower timeframe. As shown in the image above.

                        "To all solo-architects and anyone looking to set-up their own studio, these 3 books provide enormous value and alternative perspectives on traditional practice models. You may have seen the terrible (and outright sad) statistics released by the RIBA benchmarking survey, confirming the average revenue for a solo-architect studio at £52k.  The reality is at least 30% (probably conservative) of that is overheads - increasingly costly PI insurance, professional memberships, equipment, software etc- leaving a salary that’s barely liveable and absolutely not reflective of the architect’s value/education. You may think that your own studio removes the cap on your earning potential - which it does - but running a solo-practice that entirely relies on architectural services is very challenging.  The challenge is not only the winning of work. It’s the agreement of a fee that is an appropriate value exchange. It’s avoiding working unhealthy hours on multiple smaller projects to stay afloat. It’s the ability to both deliver and get paid on time when many factors are outside of your control (delayed planning decisions, paused work stages) etc. Of course there are systems and approaches that can significantly improve profitability on services - the Business of Architecture UK have lots of success stories - but I’m also interested in ways we can be creative to diversify revenue streams and ease the constant pressure of time spent = money earned. Eric Reinholdt paved the way for considering digital products we can share with others for a fee. If you aren’t aware of @30X40 Design Workshop you need to check out Eric’s work. The decision to explore this with Initiate has totally changed what I thought was possible and, quite unbelievably, digital product revenue is currently exceeding what i bill for services (thanks so much everyone 🙏🏻).  Supporting our core services with other streams can earn revenue irrespective of whether I’m at my laptop, at home ill, or picking my daughter up at nursery. I’d love to talk about these ideas with other architects, please do DM if you want to chat more 🤜🏼🤛🏼",
                        "When starting your own studio you’ll often hear, ‘it must be great to have control of your own time and do what you want?’ Yes, this is great but i’ve also found it one of the biggest challenges of solo-business. When you’re the only person to produce the work, manage projects, market the practice etc, it’s so easy to become chaotic.  Some days you might start sketching out ideas for a new project only to be distracted by a phone call from a contractor or an email from a client, work that’s absolutely necessary but disrupts the creative focus and flow you need as a designer. The only successful strategy I’ve found to control this is to implement Paul Graham’s Maker’s vs Manager’s Schedule which I first heard about from Eric Reinholdt of 30X40. I now plan my days as best I can around a schedule of AM making and PM managing, pushing all meetings, email responses and phone calls to the afternoon which frees up the mornings - when I feel most creative and inspired - for the work we all enjoy most. 2024 is the year i’m making every effort to protect my time and creative energy - I’m positive this will translate into better architecture for my clients. Let me know any tips that work for you. I’ll keep you updated with how I get on. #architecture #archipreneur #solopractice #soloarchitect #designstudio #architecturestudio #creativestudio",
                        "Iteration 1️⃣2️⃣3️⃣ No good architect produces one design idea and ends there.  Good design requires iteration, where we test ideas, sketch and sketch again. Every sketch either unlocking a new trail of thought or eliminating ideas that aren’t working out.  I’ve been looking at elevations for this historic barn conversion over the past few days, exploring ways of introducing natural light and passive ventilation with minimal demolition. In the timely LinkedIn words of Steven Biersteker, ‘if you dont test multiple ideas you will end up with a bad one’.

                        "Producing fee proposals and talking about money can be one of the most daunting and isolating aspects of running a solo-design business (especially as we designers aren’t always comfortable with talking money). This was certainly the case for me. However, if you’re leaving corporate practice to run your own studio, it’s critical you know your ‘Breakeven Rate’ to ensure your fees are sustainable and resilient. Here’s how I do it, and whilst issuing proposals and negotiating fees still brings me some baked-in apprehension, knowing my baseline brings me huge confidence. TIP 1: at the start it’s difficult to predict how many hours it will take you to complete your service. This is natural as your developing your own processes, but try to record the time spent and refine your offer over as you develop. TIP 2: start with super-lean overheads that will reduce your Breakeven Rate and allow you to be as profitable and flexible as possible. There’s no rush, and you can expand once you’ve found your feet. #architecture #archipreneur #architecturestudio #creativestudio #designer #designbusiness #startup #SmallBusiness #feeproposal ",
                        "My Client Onboarding Process 🤝🏼 1️⃣ Enquiry Email / Call Initial enquiries typically come via phone calls but also email or social media messages. This is our first point of contact where we discuss the broad details of your project together. 2️⃣ Assess Suitability Not every enquiry an architect will receive is a good fit for their skill set, experience and practice ethos, so we must assess whether we should take it on and can allocate it the resources it requires.  Sometimes projects are too large or too small / in a sector we do not have experience in / do not fit with our design ethos / are too far too travel / the timeline is too tight, etc.  If a project is a good fit, we move to the next stage. If it’s a not-so-good fit, we call to explain and are as helpful as possible by referring you to other suitable practices locally. 3️⃣ Consultation Call / Visit This is always a fun part of the process, where we meet each other (often on site), and discuss the high-level ideas, budget, timeline, fees and next steps for your project. This meeting is almost always filled with enthusiasm and excitement for what’s ahead. 4️⃣ Fee Proposal Following the consultation, we follow up with a detailed fee proposal for our services. We make sure to talk about our fees with you in the enquiry call and consultation meeting, so the proposal does not come as a surprise. 5️⃣ Contract + Pre-Commencement Fee Prior to starting work, we ensure an appointment contract and pre-commencement fee is agreed, setting us off on a correct, professional foundation. 6️⃣ Welcome Email + Client Portal Finally, to kick things off, we send a welcome email with a link to our Notion Client Portal, a platform where the key details of your project are stored and a space for ongoing collaboration together. 🔗 Client Portal available via link in bio Happy Friday everyone 🤜🏼🤛🏼 #architecture #onboarding #architecturestudio #designstudio #creativestudio #archipreneur #soloarchitect #clientportal #notion",

                        "As 2023 ends I’ve been reflecting on the progress of the studio and, as always, aim to make solo-practice as transparent as I can with you guys. 2023 has been an amazing year for Initiate. We’ve grown this account by +70k followers, made great connections and worked with wonderful clients. However, as some of you know, one of the greatest challenges as a sole-practitioner is resilience through time. This is especially the case in architecture, as we often rely solely on services which can be stop-start (often through no fault of our own - recession, clients pausing work, delayed planning approvals, etc). This unpredictability puts big pressure on cashflow. In response, 2023 has been a year of exploring resilience in my work by diversifying revenue streams. To share these, here are the five ways i’ve earned money this year and avoided sole-reliance on services (most money to least): 1️⃣ Architectural Services The majority of Initiate’s revenue comes from fees to design and deliver architectural projects. It’s been wonderful to work with a range of clients this year, including those in the private, public and third sectors. 2️⃣ Digital Products (I can’t believe I’m saying this..!) since launching digital products in July, the revenue has almost matched that of design fees. This is totally owed to the support of you guys, and I could not be more grateful. Digital products have become an invaluable supporting revenue stream and I’ve taken so much pleasure in seeing you use these. In 2024 I’ll be sharing more of the assets you guys have requested 🙏🏻 3️⃣ Consultancy to Others I’ve provided consultancy to my former practice/larger practices, specifically on the adaptive re-use of historic buildings. I charge an hourly rate for support with the design/delivery of projects. 4️⃣ Teaching at University I’ve taught design one-day-per-week at the WSA since 2021, which i value enormously. This is a consistent weekly income. 5️⃣ Affiliate Links I’ve been compiling a list of equipment/products I use in practice, providing affiliate links for those who are interested. The income is minimal but I enjoy sharing well crafted products and/or those that save me time.",

When I’ve met with a prospective client and agree we’re a good fit, I’ll prepare the proposal tailored to the specific project - all the while keeping things exciting and trying to set my studio apart from the competition. Once the scope and fee is agreed in principle, I then follow up with the necessary but less exciting appointment documents before kicking off our work.

                        "Cutaway Isometric Drawings ✍🏻 I’m finishing up a study for Bridgend County Borough Council this week, preparing a series of adaptive re-use approaches for vacant Welsh chapels. The cutaway isometric drawing is an effective style to communicate internal spatial relationships, and I’ve been using it to present the idea of replacing overly subdivided spaces with furniture like ‘buildings within buildings’ that respect historic character. My workflow for these is quite simple, using a sketch up model that is rendered with Enscape and edited in Photoshop.  More on the adaptive re-use proposals soon.

I let it simmer for 10 minutes, then allowed it to go back to room temperature prior to blending and straining.  The result did have corn undertones but it was still very subtle.\n\nHow can I get more of that rich punch of roasted corn more front and center?  Is there a better way to infuse the corn into the milk?  Should I also be trying to infuse the caramel with corn somehow?  Perhaps I should shoot to include a popcorn flavor, is so how would I go about that?\n\nAppreciate any tips or if there is a better subreddit please let me know!",

                    "description": "Denzel Curry. Denny Cascade. Zeltron 6 Billion. The Black Metal Terrorist.\n\nA man of many names and talents, Denzel Curry is a rapper from Carol City, Florida who has been making some of the most head-banging yet simultaneously nuanced hip-hop out there for a better part of the last decade.\n\nThough most people know him as the guy who rapped fast to kids flipping water bottles, Curry’s albums present an artist with much more musical depth and variation than the memes tied to him would suggest. To bring to light how complete an artist Curry is, we wanted to examine his lyrics with text mining methods to uncover specific lyrical insights.\n\n**Methodology**\n\nThe data for this project was taken from genius.com. To scrape the lyrics, we used the “genius” package in R, which allows one to get all the lyrics of any song or album for any artist. For this portion of our project, we used the lyrics from *TA13OO*.\n\nWhen humans read text, we often try to think of its emotional intent, allowing us to classify the general mood and tone of the writing. Sentiment analysis has the same objective, as it attempts to find the underlying sentiments of a certain chunk of text.\n\nOften, sentiment analysis marks text by using dictionaries. Dictionaries such as *AFINN*, *bing* and *nrc* give either sentiment scores for certain words or categorize words into different sentiments. Using these, we often assign scores or sentiments to each word in a body of text and either take the sum of our sentiments or calculate scores to develop quantitative measures of sentiments. For our project, we used the *nrc* lexical from the “tidytext” package in R, which is a 2-column dataframe of 6468 unique words and the sentiments that they convey: positive, negative, anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, and trust.\n\nTo prepare our data for analysis, we implemented a natural language processing concept known as lemmatizing. Lemmatizing involves converting a word to its root word, or ‘lemma’; for example, words such as “playing” and “played” simply become “play”. This makes it easy for our NLP dictionary to limit our analysis to one variation of a given word, since different forms of a word generally carry the same sentiment.\n\nIn order to ready our scraped lyrics for sentiment analysis, we parsed the line-by-line lyrics into separate words on each row. Then, we inner-joined our dataframe of lyrics with the *nrc* lexical. The output was a data frame with each word in the lyrics and its associated sentiment. We condensed the data and added up the counts for sentiments by song, thus giving us sentiment counts for each of the ten sentiments for all songs.\n\n**Welcome to the Darker Side of Taboo**\n\nLast year, Curry released a riveting 13-track personal odyssey in *TA13OO*. One of the best hip-hop albums of the decade thus far, *TA13OO* boasts an incredibly wide range of hip-hop sensibilities; from braggadocious, trunk-knocking trap bangers to relatable, introspective ballads, the album features a trove of material that almost any music fan could find enjoyment in.\n\nOne interesting aspect that accentuates the variety of material on the album is the concept that Curry focused the album around. He parsed and released the album in three acts: Light, Gray and Dark. The music starts out relatively upbeat and vibrant in the leading Light act. As we progress through the album, the music and lyrics both get increasingly dark and despondent, culminating in a furious storm of an ending. While the album as a whole has a predominantly melancholic tone, it evolves musically and lyrically through the acts to develop its concept.\n\nWe thought it would be particularly interesting to analyze this album through the lens of sentiment analysis, since the album is largely centered on a variety of emotions. We wanted to know if analytical methods of text analysis could give us an interesting point of view on the music at hand. Thus, we grouped the songs in *TA13OO* by act and examined sentiment distributions through the album.\n\n**Light Act**\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/RqVJKws\n\nAs evidenced by the plot, the Light act has a fairly even spread of emotions throughout. One might be surprised to observe that seemingly negative emotions such as negativity itself, anger and fear match and even outrank seemingly positive emotions such as positivity itself, joy and trust. However, as previously mentioned, the album has undercurrents of gloom throughout. Take the opening track, “Taboo”, for example; though this song opens the Light act, the subject matter is intensely sorrowful, as he calmly sings to a victim of molestation, perhaps in an attempt to cope with some personal demons. Some tracks, such as “Black Balloons”, exemplify the balanced nature of this act of the album. On this song, Curry and GoldLink mull over the depressive thoughts that hang over their heads in the form of black balloons. Though the song deals with many sinister emotions, the ultimate message of the song is one of perseverance:\n\n&gt; Soon, black balloons pop / Let it be the day the pain stops.\n\nFollowing these songs, the Light act features the most bright material on the album. Specifically, the song “Cash Maniac” has the highest sentiment counts on the entire album for anticipation, joy, positivity and trust, which makes sense as this song features Curry frivolously celebrating all of the money he has earned thus far. This continues onto the next track “Sumo”, where Curry transitions to brashly bragging about his wealth while still keeping the mood upbeat on this aggressive hit of a song.\n\n**Gray Act**\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/Gu1YSIg\n\nMoving into the Gray side, there is a distinct spike in many negative sentiments. Sentiment counts for disgust, fear and negativity nearly double relative to those in the Light act. In terms of negativity, three of the five most negative songs by count of negative words fall in this act of the album. At the start of the Gray act, we get “Super Saiyan Superman” a distinctively ethereal yet similarly boastful banger to the previous “Sumo”. Then, Curry brings “Switch It Up” and “Mad I Got It”, which both touch on a looming sense of paranoia that pervades through Curry’s entire discography. He fears people whom he perceives as his real friends turning on him on “Switch It Up”, and goes so far as to tell a story of a former friend holding him at gunpoint due to jealousy of his success and riches on “Mad I Got It”. The next two songs paint different shades of hopelessness in the album in the form of social commentary. “Sirens” bluntly addresses the political climate of the country with respect to issues such as police brutality and Donald Trump, while “Clout Cobain” sharply addresses the destructive nature of the clout-chasing circus that many young rappers in the music industry unfortunately find themselves embroiled in. According to sentiment counts, “Sirens” ranks in the top three songs in anger and fear among the whole album, and “Clout Cobain” ranks in the top four songs in negativity.\n\n**Dark Act**\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/GLtRhfe\n\nFinally, we reach the Dark act, which is by far the most vitriolic of the album. Thus far, the album has steadily mounted in dark emotions, which results in the explosion of rage that is this act of the album. Relative to the previous acts, sentiments such as anticipation, joy, positivity and trust are far lower than anger, disgust, fear, negativity, and sadness. The opener to the Dark act “The Blackest Balloon” continues some of the themes of the previous songs with a significantly sharper edge, containing material on Curry’s late brother haunting him and the untimely death of Lil Peep. “Percs” builds on these previous tracks from a unique angle, as Curry furiously differentiates himself from his peers, specifically in his opposition to recreational use of pills such as percocets and to unintelligible, mumbled flows. After these tracks, we reach the nastiest song on the whole album: “Vengeance”. By sentiment counts, this song leads the album in anger, disgust, fear, negativity and sadness; quite the violent song, as the title suggests. This song definitely fits the bill that our sentiment analysis tags it with, as Curry, JPEGMAFIA and ZillaKami all deliver murderous verses with junkyard flows that culminate into a beautifully vicious package, matched with an equally enjoyably reprehensible video. Finally, the album ends on “Black Metal Terrorist”, an absolute barrage of aggressive rhymes revolving around Curry trailblazing his path of greatness through other rappers.\n\n**Conclusions**\n\n[Here are all sentiment counts per act of the album.] (https://gist.github.com/nikhil348/b70160f08cae0f03f6f7cf62af61646d#file-summary_sentiments-csv)\n\nOverall, we feel that our sentiment analysis confirmed and enhanced our understanding of the concept of Curry’s album. As the acts of the albums got darker, so did the tone of the music, as we can confirm both by listening closely and our sentiment analysis. Unfortunately, there were some difficulties that we did our best to mitigate but were still prevalent. Unigram analysis often does not account for the context of a single word within the frame of a sentence. In the *nrc* lexical, the word “cash” is tagged as anger, anticipation, fear, joy, positivity and trust. The problem here, in the framework of our project, was that it initially classified “Cash Maniac”, unequivocally the most jubilant song on the album, as an angry and fearful one because of the sheer number of times the word “cash” is used in the song. Though we were able to spot this and alter the sentiment counts for that specific song, similar issues might have occurred in our analysis without our knowledge.\n\nThus, a next step might be to consider analyzing the lyrics using n-grams to gauge our sentiments more accurately. Still, we have something quite fascinating here, as even a relatively rudimentary analysis of the data fully supports our ear-test as music fans, showing us the power of sentiment analysis.\n\nOne of the punchier lines on *TA1300* comes from “Switch It Up”, where Curry says:\n\n&gt; They only know Denzel Curry / But they really don’t know Denzel!\n\nHopefully, we now have a better understanding of who he is, and how he works with and incorporates certain emotions in his music.\n\n\nIf you would like to read our full article, including more analysis on Curry's discography as a whole, you can check it out [here.] (https://medium.com/@ucladatares/analyzing-denzel-currys-lyrics-through-text-mining-methods-63608318d2)\n\nIf you would like to see our code, you can check it out [here.] (https://github.com/nikhil348/Denzel-Curry-Sentiment-Analysis).\n\nWe would like to acknowledge two sources which helped us immensely:\n\n* [Using Data to Find the Angriest Death Grips Song: A Code Through] (https://towardsdatascience.com/angriest-death-grips-data-song-anger-code-through-r-ded3aa2fe844) by Evan Oppenheimer\n* [Sentiment analysis with tidy data] (https://www.tidytextmining.com/sentiment.html)",

                        "The SQL HAVING Clause is the Excel Pivot Table Filter Equivalent in SQL. In our journey through SQL's core functionalities, we've explored a variety of statements that are essential for data manipulation and analysis. Today, I'm  delving into the HAVING clause, a pivotal feature that acts similarly to a filter in an Excel Pivot Table. This clause is instrumental when you need to filter aggregated totals, and it's always used in conjunction with GROUP BY. 🕯 A Quick SQL Refresher: 🔹 SELECT: Defines the columns you wish to select. Here, you can apply aggregate functions like Sum, Count, Min, Max to numeric columns. It's important to note that any non-aggregated columns must be included in the GROUP BY clause. 🔹FROM: Specifies the database table from which you're selecting the columns. 🔹WHERE: Filters the dataset to a specified criteria. 🔹GROUP BY: Determines the columns you are aggregating data by. 🔹HAVING: Today's focus, filtering the results of aggregated columns for more precise analysis. ♨ Practical Example: Analyzing Product Profitability in Ireland Consider a scenario where we aim to select products and their total profit from a sales table, focusing only on profitable sales that occurred in Ireland. Here's how we structure our query: SELECT Product, SUM(Profit) AS Total -- Selecting Products and Total Profit FROM Sales_Table  WHERE Country = 'IE' -- Narrowing down to sales in Ireland  GROUP BY Product -- Aggregating Sum by Product  HAVING Total > 0 -- Filtering for profit-making products  In the accompanying video, I provide a concrete example of applying this concept using Google Big Query. A crucial takeaway is the distinction between the WHERE clause, which filters the initial dataset, and the HAVING clause, which refines the results after aggregation with GROUP BY. 🔎 Why It Matters Understanding and effectively using the HAVING clause can significantly enhance your data analysis capabilities, offering a level of specificity and control comparable to filtering aggregated data in Excel Pivot Tables. #sql  #sqltips  #dataanalysis  #dataanalytics  #financeanalyst",

                        "Wildcards are extremely powerful for filtering data in SQL. They allow you to pattern match strings which opens up use cases like customer search with different entity names, etc. This is crucial for finance data analysis from a database in order to pull a slice of data small enough for data analysis in a spreadsheet.  Wildcards are used in the where clause and are accompanied with the Like keyword and a string.  Example: (Pull all customers starting with Google)  Select *  from  sales Where Customer Like 'Google%'     The most frequently used wildcards are % and _.  ✅ % - Stands for any amount of characters or no characters. It can be used for matching strings beginning with certain characters (a%). Ending with certain characters (%ae) or containing characters (%ae%). ✅ _ - Stands for exact number of characters. For example 'a___' matches strings beginning with a and spanning four characters.  I give a few concrete examples in the video below.  #sql  #sqltips  #likesql #dataanalysis  #financeanalytics",

                        "🔍 The WHERE Clause in SQL: Filtering Numeric Data Precisely 🔍 The WHERE clause is a powerful tool in SQL, nestled between the FROM and SELECT clauses. It filters your query to return exactly the data you need. In this post and video below, I'll explore several methods for filtering numeric data, focusing on goals and fouls from a recent match table. Example: Finding Players Who Scored No Goals SELECT Player FROM Match WHERE Goals = 0; 1. Equality and Comparison Operators Beyond equality, the WHERE clause supports various comparison operators such as <, >, <=, >=, and <> (not equal to). Example: Returning Players Who Scored SELECT Player FROM Match WHERE Goals <> 0; 2. IN and BETWEEN The BETWEEN clause is used to query within a numeric range, always used with AND. SELECT Player FROM Match WHERE Goals BETWEEN 1 AND 2; IN allows specifying a set of values, returning rows that match any of these values. SELECT Player FROM Match WHERE Goals IN (1, 2); 3. AND / OR AND/OR clauses enable the use of multiple conditions, allowing for more nuanced queries. Example: To find players who both scored and fouled: SELECT Player FROM Match WHERE Goals > 0 AND Fouls > 0; To find players who either scored or fouled: SELECT Player FROM Match WHERE Goals > 0 OR Fouls > 0; Stay tuned for next week's focus on text filtering in the WHERE clause.

SQL knowledge will also improve skills in other parts of the finance analytics technology stack such as Spreadsheets, Visualisation and extracting data from Finance Systems such as Oracle and SAP. The starting point of SQL is the Select Statement which allows the user to select data from database tables. This is what I use more than anything else  to retrieve data for reports or visuals. The select statement has many variations, I cover my Top 5 in the below video. If you want to follow along I am using Google Big Query which is free to use by visiting the link below https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/sandbox. 5 Uses of the Select Statement  1️⃣ Select column(s) from table  2️⃣ Select * from table - Which selects all columns  3️⃣ Select Distinct column(s) from table - Which gives you distinct column values or combinations of columns if multiple are selected.  4️⃣ Select Count(*) from table where column = \"\" - Selects a Count of all Rows in a Table which is usually used with a filter specified in the where clause  5️⃣ Select column(s), count(*) from table group by column(s) - Provides counts for all column(s) selected.

                        "SENTIMENT: BEARISH \t•\tIndicator Reason: The MACD on the chart provided is trending downwards, with the MACD line crossing below the signal line, which is a bearish signal. Additionally, the RSI is at 42.96, which suggests the market is neither overbought nor oversold, but the downward trend in RSI indicates increasing bearish momentum. Economic Analysis: The upcoming economic data today includes significant events like the US Trade Balance and NFIB Small Business Optimism Index. A higher trade deficit could weaken the USD, while a rise in business optimism might support market confidence. However, the broader context of recent negative German Industrial Production data could weigh on market sentiment . Key Economic Event Today: Watch out for the US Trade Balance report, scheduled at 08:30. A figure significantly below the -64.30B forecast could indicate worsening economic conditions, potentially influencing market sentiment negatively. Support and Resistance: From the chart, there appears to be a support level around the 37500 range; if the Dow breaks below this, it could see further declines towards the 37250 region as per the recent analysis .",

                        "The SQL HAVING Clause is the Excel Pivot Table Filter Equivalent in SQL. In our journey through SQL's core functionalities, we've explored a variety of statements that are essential for data manipulation and analysis. Today, I'm  delving into the HAVING clause, a pivotal feature that acts similarly to a filter in an Excel Pivot Table. This clause is instrumental when you need to filter aggregated totals, and it's always used in conjunction with GROUP BY. 🕯 A Quick SQL Refresher: 🔹 SELECT: Defines the columns you wish to select. Here, you can apply aggregate functions like Sum, Count, Min, Max to numeric columns. It's important to note that any non-aggregated columns must be included in the GROUP BY clause. 🔹FROM: Specifies the database table from which you're selecting the columns. 🔹WHERE: Filters the dataset to a specified criteria. 🔹GROUP BY: Determines the columns you are aggregating data by. 🔹HAVING: Today's focus, filtering the results of aggregated columns for more precise analysis. ♨ Practical Example: Analyzing Product Profitability in Ireland Consider a scenario where we aim to select products and their total profit from a sales table, focusing only on profitable sales that occurred in Ireland. Here's how we structure our query: SELECT Product, SUM(Profit) AS Total -- Selecting Products and Total Profit FROM Sales_Table  WHERE Country = 'IE' -- Narrowing down to sales in Ireland  GROUP BY Product -- Aggregating Sum by Product  HAVING Total > 0 -- Filtering for profit-making products  In the accompanying video, I provide a concrete example of applying this concept using Google Big Query. A crucial takeaway is the distinction between the WHERE clause, which filters the initial dataset, and the HAVING clause, which refines the results after aggregation with GROUP BY. 🔎 Why It Matters Understanding and effectively using the HAVING clause can significantly enhance your data analysis capabilities, offering a level of specificity and control comparable to filtering aggregated data in Excel Pivot Tables. #sql  #sqltips  #dataanalysis  #dataanalytics  #financeanalyst",

                        "Wildcards are extremely powerful for filtering data in SQL. They allow you to pattern match strings which opens up use cases like customer search with different entity names, etc. This is crucial for finance data analysis from a database in order to pull a slice of data small enough for data analysis in a spreadsheet.  Wildcards are used in the where clause and are accompanied with the Like keyword and a string.  Example: (Pull all customers starting with Google)  Select *  from  sales Where Customer Like 'Google%'     The most frequently used wildcards are % and _.  ✅ % - Stands for any amount of characters or no characters. It can be used for matching strings beginning with certain characters (a%). Ending with certain characters (%ae) or containing characters (%ae%). ✅ _ - Stands for exact number of characters. For example 'a___' matches strings beginning with a and spanning four characters.  I give a few concrete examples in the video below.  #sql  #sqltips  #likesql #dataanalysis  #financeanalytics",

                        "🔍 The WHERE Clause in SQL: Filtering Numeric Data Precisely 🔍 The WHERE clause is a powerful tool in SQL, nestled between the FROM and SELECT clauses. It filters your query to return exactly the data you need. In this post and video below, I'll explore several methods for filtering numeric data, focusing on goals and fouls from a recent match table. Example: Finding Players Who Scored No Goals SELECT Player FROM Match WHERE Goals = 0; 1. Equality and Comparison Operators Beyond equality, the WHERE clause supports various comparison operators such as <, >, <=, >=, and <> (not equal to). Example: Returning Players Who Scored SELECT Player FROM Match WHERE Goals <> 0; 2. IN and BETWEEN The BETWEEN clause is used to query within a numeric range, always used with AND. SELECT Player FROM Match WHERE Goals BETWEEN 1 AND 2; IN allows specifying a set of values, returning rows that match any of these values. SELECT Player FROM Match WHERE Goals IN (1, 2); 3. AND / OR AND/OR clauses enable the use of multiple conditions, allowing for more nuanced queries. Example: To find players who both scored and fouled: SELECT Player FROM Match WHERE Goals > 0 AND Fouls > 0; To find players who either scored or fouled: SELECT Player FROM Match WHERE Goals > 0 OR Fouls > 0; Stay tuned for next week's focus on text filtering in the WHERE clause.

Here's what the playground empowers you to do: ✅ Utilise all available OpenAI models ✅ Save prompts for future use ✅ Monitor your usage to understand the cost of each prompt ✅ Collaborate with a team in your workspace ✅ Generate OpenAI API keys compatible with multiple programming languages ✅ Seamlessly import finished examples into Python for implementation ✅ Establish spending limits to avoid unforeseen expenses In the accompanying video, I take a brief tour of the OpenAI Playground, showcasing its functionalities. #OpenAIPlayground #OpenAIAPI #chatgptprompts #chatgptusecases #ai #dataanalytics #businessanalytics ",

                        "The most valuable technical skill that has helped me in my career is SQL. We recommend it for all our analysts in Finance Analytics as it helps ground a basic understanding of how data is stored, how to query data and how data is retrieved by systems. SQL knowledge will also improve skills in other parts of the finance analytics technology stack such as Spreadsheets, Visualisation and extracting data from Finance Systems such as Oracle and SAP. The starting point of SQL is the Select Statement which allows the user to select data from database tables. This is what I use more than anything else  to retrieve data for reports or visuals. The select statement has many variations, I cover my Top 5 in the below video. If you want to follow along I am using Google Big Query which is free to use by visiting the link below https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/sandbox. 5 Uses of the Select Statement  1️⃣ Select column(s) from table  2️⃣ Select * from table - Which selects all columns  3️⃣ Select Distinct column(s) from table - Which gives you distinct column values or combinations of columns if multiple are selected.  4️⃣ Select Count(*) from table where column = \"\" - Selects a Count of all Rows in a Table which is usually used with a filter specified in the where clause  5️⃣ Select column(s), count(*) from table group by column(s) - Provides counts for all column(s) selected. Great for finding highest or lowest values on a category. #SQLforbeginners #SQLTips #SQLfordataanalysis #learnSQL #BigQuery #GoogleBigQuery #dataanalysis ",

The App store for custom GPTs is live on ChatGPT plus, allowing use of tuned GPTs for specific purposes developed by SMEs. I have been testing these out this week and so far I have had some pretty good experiences as can be seen in the video below. The GPT Marketplace provides: ✅ Chatbots tuned to suit a specific purpose. ✅ Top GPTs per category similar to the App Store ✅ A place to discover new use cases ✅ Perfect starting point for beginners #GPTMarketplace #genai #dataandanalytics #gpt4 #openai #chatgptplus #chatgptprompts ",

                        "National Anthem Sentiment Analysis Results What were the most positive and most negative national anthems? For my data analyst portfolio project , I performed National Anthem sentiment analysis in Python across different countries using  AI (VADERS algorithm in Python) to analyse the sentiment of each National Anthem, and to see which countries have the most positive and negative sentiment in their lyrics. Once the sentiment was calculated I used Power BI to put it in a dashboard. By looking at the data, we can see which countries have the most positive or negative National Anthems. This information can help us to better understand the context of the National Anthem. The data set used for this project is available here: https://github.com/analyticswithadam/Python/blob/main/Data/Anthem%20Dataset.csv Python is here: https://github.com/analyticswithadam/Python/blob/main/Anthem_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb Full VIdeo on my channel, link in the bio Data Analyst Project Sentiment Analysis Python Project #pythondataanalytics #sentimentanalysis #dataanalyst #datascience #dataprojects #dataanalystportfolio nationalanthems ",

A lot of social media managers don’t pay enough attention to this, hence they struggle to scale or even retain their clients! You should be paying attention to your CLIENT’S EXPERIENCE! A crappy client experience is like a bad customer service, no one would want to get your services if they have a bad experience with you. Here’s how to make sure that doesn’t happen 👇 💬 Communicate - make sure to maintain clear & open communication with your clients. Regularly update clients on campaign progress and results. Make sure to always keep them in the loop. 🤍 Set Clear Expectations - make sure to explain the scope of your services, deliverables, and timelines in a written agreement or contract. Clearly establish boundaries too, and stick to them! 🎙️ Be open for feedback - as long as it’s being communicated effectively and is constructive, their feedback will help you improve your services. ⚙️ Utilize tools - you can use tools that can help in client management! I optimized repeatable processes for faster turnover, I use ClickUp for this! ⤴️ Have a clear process & workflow - knowing what’s next will give your client the impression that you really know what you’re doing and that you’re a professional! It will also help you save so much time from doing the guesswork. YOUR CLIENT WILL LOVE YOU FOR THIS! Don’t worry!

                        "IF YOU REALLY WANT SOCIAL MEDIA TO WORK FOR YOUR BUSINESS, STOP DOING THESE THINGS 👇 1️⃣ Posting “CONSISTENTLY” with no strategy & goal. Posting every day, 3x a day, and with the hopes of 1 content going viral is a total waste of YOUR TIME! Use it wisely by establishing a clear goal & strategy. 2️⃣ Ignoring your analytics. I’m not saying to obsess over it. But your analytics is a quantitative data that tells you how your online presence is doing. Learn to understand them. 3️⃣ Ignoring your followers Sometimes we tend to be so obsessed with going viral or reaching “new” audiences that we forget to take care of the audience we already have. Don’t take them for granted. 4️⃣ Overly promoting your products & services. Stop bombarding your followers with overly promotional content. Strike a balance between promotional and value-driven contents. 5️⃣ Not maximizing user-generated content (UGC). Tap into your community. Encourage your customers to create content related to your products or services and share it on their accounts. 6️⃣ Inconsistent branding. Your audience should be able to tell that the content is from you based on things like brand image & brand voice. 7️⃣ Not testing other strategies. It’s good when you finally have a social media strategy that works for you! But don’t let that stop you from testing other methods. Consumer behavior changes, and that means results might be different over time. Explore new things! 8️⃣ Being Impatient Stop expecting immediate results. Building a successful Tiktok presence and increasing sales takes time. Be patient and persistent in your efforts. Was this helpful?

STOP ✋ Aesthetically pleasing content does add value and catches people's attention but they're not enough to get you those sales.  Your audience is smarter than that. 💡 Consumers are becoming increasingly skeptical of traditional advertising, which can come across as inauthentic or insincere. ❌ By creating content that feels more like what influencers or content creators might produce, brands can build trust with their audiences and establish themselves as more credible sources of information. If you want to convert, take a look at creators and influencers in the same niche. Take note of the type of content they're putting out.

                        "SENTIMENT: BEARISH \t•\tIndicator Reason: The MACD on the chart provided is trending downwards, with the MACD line crossing below the signal line, which is a bearish signal. Additionally, the RSI is at 42.96, which suggests the market is neither overbought nor oversold, but the downward trend in RSI indicates increasing bearish momentum. Economic Analysis: The upcoming economic data today includes significant events like the US Trade Balance and NFIB Small Business Optimism Index. A higher trade deficit could weaken the USD, while a rise in business optimism might support market confidence. However, the broader context of recent negative German Industrial Production data could weigh on market sentiment . Key Economic Event Today: Watch out for the US Trade Balance report, scheduled at 08:30. A figure significantly below the -64.30B forecast could indicate worsening economic conditions, potentially influencing market sentiment negatively. Support and Resistance: From the chart, there appears to be a support level around the 37500 range; if the Dow breaks below this, it could see further declines towards the 37250 region as per the recent analysis .",

                        "The SQL HAVING Clause is the Excel Pivot Table Filter Equivalent in SQL. In our journey through SQL's core functionalities, we've explored a variety of statements that are essential for data manipulation and analysis. Today, I'm  delving into the HAVING clause, a pivotal feature that acts similarly to a filter in an Excel Pivot Table. This clause is instrumental when you need to filter aggregated totals, and it's always used in conjunction with GROUP BY. 🕯 A Quick SQL Refresher: 🔹 SELECT: Defines the columns you wish to select. Here, you can apply aggregate functions like Sum, Count, Min, Max to numeric columns. It's important to note that any non-aggregated columns must be included in the GROUP BY clause. 🔹FROM: Specifies the database table from which you're selecting the columns. 🔹WHERE: Filters the dataset to a specified criteria. 🔹GROUP BY: Determines the columns you are aggregating data by. 🔹HAVING: Today's focus, filtering the results of aggregated columns for more precise analysis. ♨ Practical Example: Analyzing Product Profitability in Ireland Consider a scenario where we aim to select products and their total profit from a sales table, focusing only on profitable sales that occurred in Ireland. Here's how we structure our query: SELECT Product, SUM(Profit) AS Total -- Selecting Products and Total Profit FROM Sales_Table  WHERE Country = 'IE' -- Narrowing down to sales in Ireland  GROUP BY Product -- Aggregating Sum by Product  HAVING Total > 0 -- Filtering for profit-making products  In the accompanying video, I provide a concrete example of applying this concept using Google Big Query. A crucial takeaway is the distinction between the WHERE clause, which filters the initial dataset, and the HAVING clause, which refines the results after aggregation with GROUP BY. 🔎 Why It Matters Understanding and effectively using the HAVING clause can significantly enhance your data analysis capabilities, offering a level of specificity and control comparable to filtering aggregated data in Excel Pivot Tables. #sql  #sqltips  #dataanalysis  #dataanalytics  #financeanalyst",

                        "Wildcards are extremely powerful for filtering data in SQL. They allow you to pattern match strings which opens up use cases like customer search with different entity names, etc. This is crucial for finance data analysis from a database in order to pull a slice of data small enough for data analysis in a spreadsheet.  Wildcards are used in the where clause and are accompanied with the Like keyword and a string.  Example: (Pull all customers starting with Google)  Select *  from  sales Where Customer Like 'Google%'     The most frequently used wildcards are % and _.  ✅ % - Stands for any amount of characters or no characters. It can be used for matching strings beginning with certain characters (a%). Ending with certain characters (%ae) or containing characters (%ae%). ✅ _ - Stands for exact number of characters. For example 'a___' matches strings beginning with a and spanning four characters.  I give a few concrete examples in the video below.  #sql  #sqltips  #likesql #dataanalysis  #financeanalytics",

                        "🔍 The WHERE Clause in SQL: Filtering Numeric Data Precisely 🔍 The WHERE clause is a powerful tool in SQL, nestled between the FROM and SELECT clauses. It filters your query to return exactly the data you need. In this post and video below, I'll explore several methods for filtering numeric data, focusing on goals and fouls from a recent match table. Example: Finding Players Who Scored No Goals SELECT Player FROM Match WHERE Goals = 0; 1. Equality and Comparison Operators Beyond equality, the WHERE clause supports various comparison operators such as <, >, <=, >=, and <> (not equal to). Example: Returning Players Who Scored SELECT Player FROM Match WHERE Goals <> 0; 2. IN and BETWEEN The BETWEEN clause is used to query within a numeric range, always used with AND. SELECT Player FROM Match WHERE Goals BETWEEN 1 AND 2; IN allows specifying a set of values, returning rows that match any of these values. SELECT Player FROM Match WHERE Goals IN (1, 2); 3. AND / OR AND/OR clauses enable the use of multiple conditions, allowing for more nuanced queries. Example: To find players who both scored and fouled: SELECT Player FROM Match WHERE Goals > 0 AND Fouls > 0; To find players who either scored or fouled: SELECT Player FROM Match WHERE Goals > 0 OR Fouls > 0; Stay tuned for next week's focus on text filtering in the WHERE clause.

We recommend it for all our analysts in Finance Analytics as it helps ground a basic understanding of how data is stored, how to query data and how data is retrieved by systems. SQL knowledge will also improve skills in other parts of the finance analytics technology stack such as Spreadsheets, Visualisation and extracting data from Finance Systems such as Oracle and SAP. The starting point of SQL is the Select Statement which allows the user to select data from database tables. This is what I use more than anything else  to retrieve data for reports or visuals. The select statement has many variations, I cover my Top 5 in the below video. If you want to follow along I am using Google Big Query which is free to use by visiting the link below https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/sandbox. 5 Uses of the Select Statement  1️⃣ Select column(s) from table  2️⃣ Select * from table - Which selects all columns  3️⃣ Select Distinct column(s) from table - Which gives you distinct column values or combinations of columns if multiple are selected.  4️⃣ Select Count(*) from table where column = \"\" - Selects a Count of all Rows in a Table which is usually used with a filter specified in the where clause  5️⃣ Select column(s), count(*) from table group by column(s) - Provides counts for all column(s) selected.

It tries to extract the sentiment of a user using this technique and it helps the businesses to identify customer sentiments toward products, brands, or services in online feedback.\n\nA large amount of data that is generated today is unstructured, which requires processing to generate insights. Some examples of unstructured data are news articles, posts on social media, and search history. The process of analyzing natural language and making sense of it falls under the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Sentiment analysis is a common NLP task, which involves classifying texts or parts of texts into a pre-defined sentiment\n\nSentiment analysis also refers to the process of determining whether a given piece of text is positive or negative. In some variations, we consider “neutral” as a third option. This technique is commonly used to discover how people feel about a particular topic. In this video, we will be covering different topics such as, What is Sentiment Analysis and how it works?

Accuracy, speed, platform integration, etc.\n* **Head-to-head comparisons:** Has anyone compared tools like Brand24 ([https://brand24.com/](https://brand24.com/)), Sprout Social ([https://sproutsocial.com/](https://sproutsocial.com/)), and **WeCheck Social** ([https://wecheck.ai/social](https://wecheck.ai/social)? I'm especially curious about how they stack up across specific needs.\n\nI know, mentioning specific tools might seem a bit forward, but honestly, I'm genuinely confused!

                    "text": "Hello, everyone! Today, we would like to share two text mining tools: Sentiment Analysis and Named Entity Recognition. Sentiment Analysis tool classifies documents according to positive or negative sentiment. Named Entity Recognition extracts “Named Entities” (proper names, dates, prices, etc.). \n\nMore specifically, the Sentiment Analysis tool calculates the “sentiment score” of each document, indicating the use of positive or negative words. It works by applying a lexicon of terms and their associated sentiment scores to a piece of text. It also divides each document into 20 sections and calculates the sentiment score for each section.\n\nNamed Entity Recognition (NER) recognizes and extracts “Named Entities” (proper names, dates, prices, etc.) from documents within a content set, and output lists of such entities. \nIt is not designed to analyze textual features, but to extract them, and create new datasets which can then be used to contextualize content sets. \nExample “entity types”: – people (including fictional), – groups (nationalities, religious, or political), – organizations (companies, agencies, institutions), – locations (countries, states, cities), etc.\n\nWe are looking forward to your feedback on using these two text mining tools. \nYou check this link https://go.gale.com/ps/start.do?p=DSLAB&u=hkbu in our library for further information. Thanks. \n\n大家好! 今天我們想和大家分享兩個文本挖掘工具：情感分析和命名實體識別。情感分析工具是對文檔進行正面和負面情感的分類。命名實體識別是為了提取 \"命名實體\"（專有名詞、日期、價格等）。 \n更具體地說，情感分析工具計算每份文檔的 \"情感分數\"，這表明其中使用的是積極或消極的詞彙。它的工作原理是將一個術語詞典及其相關的情感分數應用於一段文本。此外，它還將每個檔分為20個部分，並計算每個部分的情感分數。\n命名實體識別（NER）從內容集中的文檔中識別和提取 \"命名實體\"（專有名詞、日期、價格等），並輸出此類實體的清單。\n它不是用來分析文本特徵的，而是用來提取這些特徵，並創建新的資料集，然後可以用來確定內容集的上下文。\n實體類型 的例子：--人（包括虛構的），--團體（國籍、宗教或政治），--組織（公司、機構、機關），--地點（國家、州、城市），等等。\n\nCr: https://go.gale.com/ps/start.do?p=DSLAB&u=hkbu \n\n#hkbutiis #浸大翻譯系\n#TextMiningTool #文本挖掘工具\n#SentimentAnalysisTool #情感分析工具\n#NamedEntityRecognition #專有名詞識別工具\n#StudyTool #學習的工具\n#TextAnalysis #文本分析\n#tiisstudents #浸大翻譯系學生\n#HongKongBaptistUnveristy #香港浸會大學",

Sentiment Analysis tools, developed for analyzing social media text or product reviews, work poorly on a Software Engineering (SE) dataset. Since prior studies have found developers expressing sentiments during various SE activities, there is a need for a customized sentiment analysis tool for the SE domain. On this goal, we manually labeled 2000 review comments to build a training dataset and used our dataset to evaluate seven popular sentiment analysis tools. The poor performances of the existing sentiment analysis tools motivated us to build SentiCR, a sentiment analysis tool especially designed for code review comments. We evaluated SentiCR using one hundred 10-fold cross-validations of eight supervised learning algorithms. We found a model, trained using the Gradient Boosting Tree (GBT) algorithm, providing the highest mean accuracy (83%), the highest mean precision (67.8%), and the highest mean recall (58.4%) in identifying negative review comments.",

Alongside tracking clicks, traffic, mentions, likes, comments, and shares, there’s one particular metric that can help in zeroing in on the ‘why’ and ‘how’ rather than just the ‘what’ – sentiment analysis.

It is a part of natural language processing in which series of words are being judged and categorize them as positive, negative and neutral.\n\nHow is it helpful?\nMore or less every organization uses social media for marketing or to know public opinion for their product and services. However these conpanies do manual research or use tools to understand the sentiment of their customers.\n\nHow it works?\nLet's assume an e-learning platform want to know how their learners view courses. So they should start crawling the comments and tweets directly on their social media pages.\n\"Nice platform to get knowledge of Data science and AI\"\n\"Price of courses are quite high\"\n\"Video content is fantastic and the project was really very practical\"\n\nThese may be the few comments on their social media pages. Now we will have to categorize them as positive, negative or neutral. Looking at the first two comments, we can conclude that first one is positive and second is negative. But it can be a tone of sarcastic many times. A good sentimental analysis tool should be able to identify accurately. The more and better labelled data we use to train our model, the model will give more accurate results.\n/\n/\n#machinelearning #artificialintelligence #machinelearningalgorithms #machinelearningtools #machinelearningengineer #reinforcementlearning #neuralnetworks #deeplearning #computerscience #datavisualization #datascience #dataanalytics #data #sentimentanalysis #datascientist #datascienceisfuture #coding #pythonprogrammers #sentimentanalysistool",

Even if an issue is resolved, a poor attitude can tarnish the entire customer experience. As an industry, we must continue to innovate and adapt to ensure we're truly connecting with customers.

With the growth of social media and other online platforms, sentiment analysis has become increasingly crucial for businesses and organizations seeking to monitor and comprehend customer feedback as well as opinions.

Many people call it junk science. However, in Indiana it is admissible. In Turner v. State of Indiana, 953 N.E.2d 1039, a defendant challenged the admissibility of expert testimony comparing tool marks on a spent shell casing found at the scene of a crime to tool markings found on an unspent round found in his home. The Supreme Court of Indiana held the expert’s testimony regarding fire arms tool mark identification was admissible and upheld the defendant’s conviction. In that case they did not have the firearm to use in the comparison and it was still admissible. There is a lengthy discussion in the opinion if you want to read.",

I am almost finished with the basic objectives I planned but there is always room for improvement. I am somewhat new to both Kubernetes and Terraform, hence looking for some feedback on what I can further work on. The project is developed entirely on a local Minikube cluster and I have included the system specifications and local setup in the README.\n\n  \nGithub link: [https://github.com/nama1arpit/reddit-streaming-pipeline](https://github.com/nama1arpit/reddit-streaming-pipeline)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Reddit Sentiment Analysis Data Pipeline is designed to collect live comments from Reddit using the Reddit API, pass them through Kafka message broker, process them using Apache Spark, store the processed data in Cassandra, and visualize/compare sentiment scores of various subreddits in Grafana. The pipeline leverages containerization and utilizes a Kubernetes cluster for deployment, with infrastructure management handled by Terraform.\n\nHere's the brief workflow:\n\n* A containerized Python application to collect real-time reddit comments from certain subreddits and ingest them into the Kafka broker\n* Zookeeper and Kafka pods act as a message broker for providing the comments to other applications.\n* A Spark container running job to consume raw comments data from the kafka topic, process it and pour it into the data sink, i.e. Cassandra tables.\n* A Cassandra database is used to store and persist the data generated by the Spark job.\n* Grafana establishes a connection with the Cassandra database. It queries the aggregated data from Cassandra and presents it visually to users  through a dashboard. Grafana dashboard sample link: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nama1arpit/reddit-streaming-pipeline/main/images/grafana\\_dashboard.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nama1arpit/reddit-streaming-pipeline/main/images/grafana_dashboard.png)\n\nI am relatively new to almost all the technologies used here, especially Kafka, Kubernetes and Terraform, and I've gained a lot of knowledge while working on this side project. I have noted some important improvements that I would like to make in the README. Please feel free to point out if there are any cool visualisations I can do with such data. I'm eager to hear any feedback you may have regarding the project!\n\nPS: I'm also looking for more interesting projects and opportunities to work on. Feel free to DM me\n\nEdit: I added this post right before my 18 hour flight. After landing, I was surprised by the attention it got. Thank you for all the kind words and stars.",

A small fee is required for this, but it’s usually very valuable in showing you the location of sewer and surface water utilities at your site. ➕ Land Registry Search the Land Registry through their online service to find any easements, rights of way or covenants on your site. Do you use any other useful resources? Let me know ⬇️ #architecturetok #designtok #architect #siteanalysis #architecture #architecturestudio #archipreneur ",

                    "text": "[OC] Analyzing TA13OO with Sentiment AnalysisDenzel Curry. Denny Cascade. Zeltron 6 Billion. The Black Metal Terrorist.\n\nA man of many names and talents, Denzel Curry is a rapper from Carol City, Florida who has been making some of the most head-banging yet simultaneously nuanced hip-hop out there for a better part of the last decade.\n\nThough most people know him as the guy who rapped fast to kids flipping water bottles, Curry’s albums present an artist with much more musical depth and variation than the memes tied to him would suggest. To bring to light how complete an artist Curry is, we wanted to examine his lyrics with text mining methods to uncover specific lyrical insights.\n\n**Methodology**\n\nThe data for this project was taken from genius.com. To scrape the lyrics, we used the “genius” package in R, which allows one to get all the lyrics of any song or album for any artist. For this portion of our project, we used the lyrics from *TA13OO*.\n\nWhen humans read text, we often try to think of its emotional intent, allowing us to classify the general mood and tone of the writing. Sentiment analysis has the same objective, as it attempts to find the underlying sentiments of a certain chunk of text.\n\nOften, sentiment analysis marks text by using dictionaries. Dictionaries such as *AFINN*, *bing* and *nrc* give either sentiment scores for certain words or categorize words into different sentiments. Using these, we often assign scores or sentiments to each word in a body of text and either take the sum of our sentiments or calculate scores to develop quantitative measures of sentiments. For our project, we used the *nrc* lexical from the “tidytext” package in R, which is a 2-column dataframe of 6468 unique words and the sentiments that they convey: positive, negative, anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, and trust.\n\nTo prepare our data for analysis, we implemented a natural language processing concept known as lemmatizing. Lemmatizing involves converting a word to its root word, or ‘lemma’; for example, words such as “playing” and “played” simply become “play”. This makes it easy for our NLP dictionary to limit our analysis to one variation of a given word, since different forms of a word generally carry the same sentiment.\n\nIn order to ready our scraped lyrics for sentiment analysis, we parsed the line-by-line lyrics into separate words on each row. Then, we inner-joined our dataframe of lyrics with the *nrc* lexical. The output was a data frame with each word in the lyrics and its associated sentiment. We condensed the data and added up the counts for sentiments by song, thus giving us sentiment counts for each of the ten sentiments for all songs.\n\n**Welcome to the Darker Side of Taboo**\n\nLast year, Curry released a riveting 13-track personal odyssey in *TA13OO*. One of the best hip-hop albums of the decade thus far, *TA13OO* boasts an incredibly wide range of hip-hop sensibilities; from braggadocious, trunk-knocking trap bangers to relatable, introspective ballads, the album features a trove of material that almost any music fan could find enjoyment in.\n\nOne interesting aspect that accentuates the variety of material on the album is the concept that Curry focused the album around. He parsed and released the album in three acts: Light, Gray and Dark. The music starts out relatively upbeat and vibrant in the leading Light act. As we progress through the album, the music and lyrics both get increasingly dark and despondent, culminating in a furious storm of an ending. While the album as a whole has a predominantly melancholic tone, it evolves musically and lyrically through the acts to develop its concept.\n\nWe thought it would be particularly interesting to analyze this album through the lens of sentiment analysis, since the album is largely centered on a variety of emotions. We wanted to know if analytical methods of text analysis could give us an interesting point of view on the music at hand. Thus, we grouped the songs in *TA13OO* by act and examined sentiment distributions through the album.\n\n**Light Act**\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/RqVJKws\n\nAs evidenced by the plot, the Light act has a fairly even spread of emotions throughout. One might be surprised to observe that seemingly negative emotions such as negativity itself, anger and fear match and even outrank seemingly positive emotions such as positivity itself, joy and trust. However, as previously mentioned, the album has undercurrents of gloom throughout. Take the opening track, “Taboo”, for example; though this song opens the Light act, the subject matter is intensely sorrowful, as he calmly sings to a victim of molestation, perhaps in an attempt to cope with some personal demons. Some tracks, such as “Black Balloons”, exemplify the balanced nature of this act of the album. On this song, Curry and GoldLink mull over the depressive thoughts that hang over their heads in the form of black balloons. Though the song deals with many sinister emotions, the ultimate message of the song is one of perseverance:\n\n> Soon, black balloons pop / Let it be the day the pain stops.\n\nFollowing these songs, the Light act features the most bright material on the album. Specifically, the song “Cash Maniac” has the highest sentiment counts on the entire album for anticipation, joy, positivity and trust, which makes sense as this song features Curry frivolously celebrating all of the money he has earned thus far. This continues onto the next track “Sumo”, where Curry transitions to brashly bragging about his wealth while still keeping the mood upbeat on this aggressive hit of a song.\n\n**Gray Act**\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/Gu1YSIg\n\nMoving into the Gray side, there is a distinct spike in many negative sentiments. Sentiment counts for disgust, fear and negativity nearly double relative to those in the Light act. In terms of negativity, three of the five most negative songs by count of negative words fall in this act of the album. At the start of the Gray act, we get “Super Saiyan Superman” a distinctively ethereal yet similarly boastful banger to the previous “Sumo”. Then, Curry brings “Switch It Up” and “Mad I Got It”, which both touch on a looming sense of paranoia that pervades through Curry’s entire discography. He fears people whom he perceives as his real friends turning on him on “Switch It Up”, and goes so far as to tell a story of a former friend holding him at gunpoint due to jealousy of his success and riches on “Mad I Got It”. The next two songs paint different shades of hopelessness in the album in the form of social commentary. “Sirens” bluntly addresses the political climate of the country with respect to issues such as police brutality and Donald Trump, while “Clout Cobain” sharply addresses the destructive nature of the clout-chasing circus that many young rappers in the music industry unfortunately find themselves embroiled in. According to sentiment counts, “Sirens” ranks in the top three songs in anger and fear among the whole album, and “Clout Cobain” ranks in the top four songs in negativity.\n\n**Dark Act**\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/GLtRhfe\n\nFinally, we reach the Dark act, which is by far the most vitriolic of the album. Thus far, the album has steadily mounted in dark emotions, which results in the explosion of rage that is this act of the album. Relative to the previous acts, sentiments such as anticipation, joy, positivity and trust are far lower than anger, disgust, fear, negativity, and sadness. The opener to the Dark act “The Blackest Balloon” continues some of the themes of the previous songs with a significantly sharper edge, containing material on Curry’s late brother haunting him and the untimely death of Lil Peep. “Percs” builds on these previous tracks from a unique angle, as Curry furiously differentiates himself from his peers, specifically in his opposition to recreational use of pills such as percocets and to unintelligible, mumbled flows. After these tracks, we reach the nastiest song on the whole album: “Vengeance”. By sentiment counts, this song leads the album in anger, disgust, fear, negativity and sadness; quite the violent song, as the title suggests. This song definitely fits the bill that our sentiment analysis tags it with, as Curry, JPEGMAFIA and ZillaKami all deliver murderous verses with junkyard flows that culminate into a beautifully vicious package, matched with an equally enjoyably reprehensible video. Finally, the album ends on “Black Metal Terrorist”, an absolute barrage of aggressive rhymes revolving around Curry trailblazing his path of greatness through other rappers.\n\n**Conclusions**\n\n[Here are all sentiment counts per act of the album.] (https://gist.github.com/nikhil348/b70160f08cae0f03f6f7cf62af61646d#file-summary_sentiments-csv)\n\nOverall, we feel that our sentiment analysis confirmed and enhanced our understanding of the concept of Curry’s album. As the acts of the albums got darker, so did the tone of the music, as we can confirm both by listening closely and our sentiment analysis. Unfortunately, there were some difficulties that we did our best to mitigate but were still prevalent. Unigram analysis often does not account for the context of a single word within the frame of a sentence. In the *nrc* lexical, the word “cash” is tagged as anger, anticipation, fear, joy, positivity and trust. The problem here, in the framework of our project, was that it initially classified “Cash Maniac”, unequivocally the most jubilant song on the album, as an angry and fearful one because of the sheer number of times the word “cash” is used in the song. Though we were able to spot this and alter the sentiment counts for that specific song, similar issues might have occurred in our analysis without our knowledge.\n\nThus, a next step might be to consider analyzing the lyrics using n-grams to gauge our sentiments more accurately. Still, we have something quite fascinating here, as even a relatively rudimentary analysis of the data fully supports our ear-test as music fans, showing us the power of sentiment analysis.\n\nOne of the punchier lines on *TA1300* comes from “Switch It Up”, where Curry says:\n\n> They only know Denzel Curry / But they really don’t know Denzel!\n\nHopefully, we now have a better understanding of who he is, and how he works with and incorporates certain emotions in his music.\n\n\nIf you would like to read our full article, including more analysis on Curry's discography as a whole, you can check it out [here.] (https://medium.com/@ucladatares/analyzing-denzel-currys-lyrics-through-text-mining-methods-63608318d2)\n\nIf you would like to see our code, you can check it out [here.] (https://github.com/nikhil348/Denzel-Curry-Sentiment-Analysis).\n\nWe would like to acknowledge two sources which helped us immensely:\n\n* [Using Data to Find the Angriest Death Grips Song: A Code Through] (https://towardsdatascience.com/angriest-death-grips-data-song-anger-code-through-r-ded3aa2fe844) by Evan Oppenheimer\n* [Sentiment analysis with tidy data] (https://www.tidytextmining.com/sentiment.html)",

Source code, pictures, and results![Source code](https://github.com/tstewart161/Reddit_Sentiment_Trader)\n\n[Hosted version](https://getquantbase.com) (how to actually run/invest in it). Folks the amount of y’all that have messaged me asking for this is absolutely AMAZING but I can’t keep up! Posting the link here for you guys\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHOW I DID THIS\n\nScraped WSB sentiment, got the top + most positively mentioned stocks on WSB (for the better part of this year, that's been $GME and $AMC, recently some $SPCE and $NVDA, and about 13 other stocks. I have the strategy rebalancing monthly. The source code is actually pretty intuitive, but essentially what it uses is VADER ( Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning), which s a model used for text sentiment analysis that is sensitive to both polarity (positive/negative) and intensity (strength) of emotion.\n\nThe way it works is by relying on a dictionary that maps lexical (aka word-based) features to emotion intensities -- these are known as sentiment scores. The overall sentiment score of a comment/post is achieved by summing up the intensity of each word in the text.\n\nIn some ways, it's easy: words like ‘love’, ‘enjoy’, ‘happy’, ‘like’ all convey a positive sentiment. Also VADER is smart enough to understand the basic context of these words, such as “did not love” as a negative statement. It also understands the emphasis of capitalization and punctuation, such as “ENJOY” which is pretty cool. Phrases like “The acting was good , but the movie could have been better” have sentiments in both polarities, which makes this kind of analysis tricky -- essentially w VADER you would analyze which part of the sentiment here is more intense.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Results and some stats:**\n\nRight now I'm up 60% YTD, compared to the SP500's 13% (the recent spikes in GME and AMC have helped tremendously)\n\n\\- The strategy is **backtested** only to the beginning of 2020, but I'm working on it. It's got an annualized return of 33% (compared to 16% for the SP500)\n\n\\- **Max drawdown of -8.7%** (aka how far it went down before coming back up -- interestingly enough, WallStreetBets weathered COVID pretty well)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHappy to answer any more questions about the process/results. I think doing stuff like this is pretty cool as someone with a foot in algo trading and traditional financial markets",
